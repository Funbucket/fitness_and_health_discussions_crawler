I do great with a fitness support group or when I'm obligated to someone to workout with. Can anyone:1. Recommend a good fitness support forum. Or2. Want to commit to starting a fitness support groupToday: I walked the dog, jogged about a mile, then did chest presses and ab work at the gym. I'm wanting to do something everyday for the next 30+Would love support to make sure I do. Any recommendations?",

				"Hi!! Congratulations on your upcoming wedding!! My wedding is in about 40 days. I'd love to be part of a fitness support group!",
				"Great. Any suggestions on how to format one? Or just use this thread for a check-in?",
				"Ali, I see where you're getting married 2 days after me. I can't believe the day is almost here. Have you figured out a fitness plan for yourself? How can I help you stick to your plan?Today pup and I walked about a mile, I jogged about half a mile then hit the fitness center for ab and arm work. Something everyday. That is my plan.",
				"I\u2019ll join! I\u2019ve been going for a long walk after work, hiking on the weekends, 30-minute strength and/or cardio workouts in the morning, and eating keto! I\u2019ve actually been pretty disciplined about it, but it\u2019s getting harder with so much last minute wedding stuff. Like last night I had to stay up late crafting a huge email to our venue coordinator since this is our last week to make changes, so I had a headache this morning and had to skip my workout. \ud83d\ude2d",
				"View Quoted Comment Kimberly, you sound disciplined. That's great! Keep up the good work!",
				"Kimberly, hope you're feeling better today and was able to grab a little fitness time. I'm heading out for a jog now.",
				"View Quoted Comment Great job on getting a jog in! Are you in an area not really affected by the heat wave, or are does it just not really bother you to jog in the heat? I got a cardio barre workout in this morning, so I\u2019m feeling good for the day!",
				"View Quoted Comment In NC. It was mid 80s for my jog. Manageable. Glad you got your workout in this morning.",
				"I'll join too. Mine is in 4 months but have a lot of pounds to loose. Bought my dress a while ago and have not been good with my diet and exercise, even though I love working out.",
				"View Quoted Comment Karla, I'd love to have someone to check-in with. I'm 24 days out. I've been doing \"something\" nearly everyday, though life so often has a way of getting in the way. Example: yesterday (Sunday) was a bust. I work night shift. So I came home, slept a couple hours then needed to go out shopping with my son. Came home, fixed dinner. Exercise did not happen. Ugh. Today is a better day. Tell me. What type of exercise do you like? What motivates you to do it? How can I help?",
				"View Quoted Comment We can certainly do that. I am working days for these next two weeks and then switching to night for a week. I love dancing, aerobics, zumba and tabata. I usually work out right after I wake up in the morning or afternoon depending on my shift. I need for someone to check in on me as well.",
				"View Quoted Comment Great! Were you able to get out this morning?I ran with the pup for about 1.5 miles this morning. Tonight I'm meeting my weekly workout trainee for full body fitness and kickboxing.",
				"View Quoted Comment Not really. I was on call and got home at 3 am. So planning on doing something in pm. Hopefully.",
				"View Quoted Comment Nurse or doctor?",
				"View Quoted Comment I am a doctor",
				"View Quoted Comment The one not paid like a doctor yet. Lol. How about you?",
				"View Quoted Comment Lol. I'm a nurse.",
				"View Quoted Comment Kimberly. 21 days. Feeling good? Feeling strong?",
				"View Quoted Comment Yes!! I actually did a weightlifting workout this morning, so extra strong today lol. How are you holding up?",
				"I'm doing good. Hit the gym with my kickboxing trainee last night. It's always good to punch something. Our weight/core training was spot on too. Keep up the strong work \ud83d\udcaa",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh that\u2019s awesome that you have a trainee! That would be so helpful in staying accountable haha.",
				"View Quoted Comment It is, but I only see her once a week - at best. So, on weeks I don't see her and on those other 6 days of the week, self-motivating becomes extremely challenging.",
				"Yesterday was a challenge. Zero desire - when I woke up - to exercise. But... somehow I powered through. Pup jogged 1.5m with me. Then I ventured to the gym for weight training. Today will be a time challenge. I have an appointment this morning, errands to run and fiance's b'day dinner. Working out may not happen. Ugh. Wish me luck.",
				"View Quoted Comment I wish you all the luck. I'm sorry I had not replied. My world collapsed for a while. My mom is recovering from hip surgery and is being ungrateful with her caretaker. And my dog almost died! She's much better now. Will start with the exercise plan again tomorrow! Send me best wishes please!",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh no. Much support and wishes coming your way. This is what I mean by life getting in the way. I hope all is getting better for you. Breathe. Deep breath. Exhale. You got this.",
				"View Quoted Comment Deep breaths is what I did today. My doggie has been better. Did some \"summer cleaning\" today and that helped exercise a bit. Also cleaned the leafs in our back yard. Mantained a well balanced diet as well. Tried some crafts for our cake topper and organized all of the wedding gifts for the guests. Keep the good work! You can do it!",
				"View Quoted Comment Glad the pup dog is doing better. Also glad you were able to get things done and stretch the body out a bit. How does the upcoming week look at being able to keep you on track?As for me, I was able to get out for a walk Thursday, Friday was a bust. Today was able to get out for a jog with the pup. Hoping for a jog and gym time on Sunday. My trainee is not available this coming week, so sadly no kickboxing. All sef-motivation this week. Ugh.",
				"Forever the rallier. It's what I do. Ali. Kimberly. - We're sitting at 2 weeks! Physically, are you ready? At best we can do some last minute tweaks. How do you feel?",
				"I\u2019ve been keeping up with my workouts during the week, but hiking on the weekends is my usual go-to and that\u2019s been impossible in this heat. \ud83d\ude2d I also have been having trouble sticking to my diet. So I\u2019m a little sad that I was super disciplined earlier in the summer but now am falling off in this final stretch.How\u2019s this week looking for you?!? And Karla, I hope both your mom and your dog are doing better!",
				"View Quoted Comment My week is going ok. I didn't get a workout or cardio in Tuesday,but got full cardio and weights in today. Tomorrow will simply be cardio but I'm on track to be able to do something everyday....until Sept 5th, which is when we leave for Vegas. If I'm not where I want to be by then, it's not gonna happen. As for eating.....all was good til someone brought cupcakes into work. Ugh. It is what it is. Stay focused. We got this!",
				"God love the puppy dog. After getting a broken 5hrs of sleep, I had ZERO to go for a jog this afternoon. It was hot outside (high 80s) and I was far from being motivated to do anything. Pup, becoming a creature of habit, sat whimpering at the front window. You guessed it. I gave in and headed out for a jog. Only did 1.25 mile, but made it out just the same. Ultimately... I'm glad I did. Tomorrow (Fri) should be full cardio and weights.",
				"View Quoted Comment That\u2019s awesome!!! Good dog, puppy!! Unfortunately my dog can\u2019t go longer walks anymore, so they are short and slow haha.Good luck with your cardio and weights today! I did weights yesterday, and my arms are feeling it. I leave next Friday morning, so I\u2019m in the final week!",
				"Weekend off and I was able to relax....a bit. Out for a hike Sat morning. Temp was ok but humidity was off the chart. Cut the hike short cause pup was panting profusely. Got 3.25 miles in, but felt like a terrible fur-momma for not bringing water....for either of us. Back to kickboxing tonight!Kimberly, you said you're taking off Friday. Destination wedding? Where to? We head to LV Sept 5th.",
				"View Quoted Comment Sounds like you are doing a great job. I can barely keep up with my daily tasks. But will get back to it tomorrow. I'm on nights unfortunately so I only get a few hours off. Hurricane coverage is also a possibility. Will try to exercise at the hospital!",
				"View Quoted Comment Stay focused. Don't get discouraged. Life often gets in the way of us taking care of ourselves. Beating ourselves up over it is counter productive. When life is crazy, set realistic goals. Even if it's just taking a walk. Hang in there v"

			"title": "Weight gain due to long Covid problems. Anyone else struggling?",
			"content": "I'm sorry if this seems like a downer. This problem has brought me down, amd I can't be the only one the last few years so maybe someone will read this and relate. I caught Covid early November 2020. I had been dating my fh less than 3 months at the time. My Covid symptoms were not bad at all, however, I developed long covid symptoms that included daily headaches, rapid pulse rate, heart palpitations, dizziness, and exhaustion. Though most of my symptoms have disappeared after medication and time, I have never regained all the energy I had prior to contracting Covid and that, along with a foot injury last summer, a high stress job, and lots of changes has affected my weight. I have gained 30 pounds since catching the virus. My wedding is still 15 months away, but I am finding no energy and no motivation to lose the weight. All the positive self talk, motivational quotes, making plans, even meal preps and scheduling workouts are not really helping. Our schedules don't help much either because the times I used to work out, we are now on the phone talking about our day. We should be moving in together late summer, and I do think that will help. But, I am finding it very difficult to find the energy and motivation that I once had and preparing my house to sell isn't helping matters. It's hard to believe just 3 years ago, I had so much energy, and now I have very little. I've been to the Dr. All my hormone levels are within \"normal\" range. The only thing that was low was Vitamin D which was very surprising. I know I'm in a cycle, a catch-22. I'll feel better and have more energy if I get back to my healthy lifestyle, but I don't have the energy to do all the meal prep I once did to get me to that point. Maybe there isn't a lot that anyone can say that I haven't already told myself, but perhaps someone else is out there struggling like me, and we can just talk it over together and maybe our shared struggles will help. We can just talk it out instead of receiving well meaning, but really not helpful advice. We can get the stress and anxiety out without any judgement about our respective stories, challenges, and just plain old gripes. Everyone thinks of me as a positive person, and I generally am, but I'm feeling too physically and emotionally drained to be positive for myself. Maybe we can be there for each other.",

				"I hear you loud and clearly!!! Kinda in the same predicament but somewhat different. I too, have gained weight. Changed to a high stress demanding a little over a year ago. Lost my father five months before that. Finally divorced my ex after having been living separate lives for about seven years. Moved in with my mother to help her and now, here I am trying to plan a microwedding!! Through all of it, I have gained a considerable amount of weight. The more I try, the worse it seems. My fiance is an 18 hour drive away, so we talk literally for two hours every evening. He's a work so his schedule is not interrupted but I'm at home. Because we video chat, there's really nothing I could be doing. It's a tough situation so, I completely understand!!! I believe we're always where we are supposed to be all if the time. Relax and breathe deeply and then plan to set tiny goals each day.....very tiny and achievable. For me, I have been watching my diet more lately. With each little victory, move the bar. In time, you'll feel better and see some results. Hang in there, Sis!! Sending love and light. \u2764",
				"View Quoted Comment Michele, I'm sorry about your father. My mother moved in with me 13 1/2 years ago due to losing her business, then had her first heart attack 2 years later. She's living with me permanently now. My grandmother lived eith me for two years prior to her death. Working out is how I dealt with the stress.",
				"This kicked me right in the feels this morning. Sending you a huge virtual hug Laura!I am in a similar predicament. I was born with hip dysplasia, and it ended up getting so bad it shredded my labrum and left me limping after walking only a block. I went from being a super toned athlete, to not even being able to walk around my neighborhood without being in pain for the next 3 to 4 days. I ended up getting major surgery, where they cut apart my pelvis, rearrange the parts, then screwed them together. I had massive complications, post surgery and nearly died. Because I couldn\u2019t do physical therapy (due to the complications) my healing was stunted. I ended up having to relearn to walk. I was on a walker for 3 months, then crutches for another 6 months. I am now 2 years post surgery and I cannot run, jump, squat, lunge\u2026 none of the things I used to do daily. I have put on over 60 lbs since surgery. It\u2019s a very helpless feeling watching all your years of hard work go down the drain and your body morph into someone you don\u2019t even recognize in the mirror. I have felt really down about it lately, and just super unhealthy. Reading your post broke my heart for you because I know exactly what you are going through. I think the next steps for both of us would be to make a list of the things we CAN do, instead of mourning the things we can\u2019t. Clean healthy eating should probably be the first step (maybe consulting a dietitian to help). And also making a list of the activities we are able to do and set realistic expectations. For instance, maybe the goal is to walk your dog 1 block every day after work. Then the following week, make it 2 blocks, then three\u2026. And so on. Or 5 mins of free weight work. Then 6 mins, then 7, etc etc.",
				"View Quoted Comment Hi Laura, thank you so very much and my condolences to you as well. I definitely need to get more exercise in. Thank you for sharing. Best to you, your mom and family. \u2764",
				"Hi Laura. I'm currently reading \"The Body keeps the score\" by Bessel Van der Kolk, MD. It has put my feelings and my journey into perspective, and I've learned to be more compassionate with myself. Rather than believing a part of me is currently missing, I am learning to take on a holistic approach to regaining connection. Perhaps this may help you as well. Best wishes.",

				"Following, as I need to manage my anxiety \ud83d\ude05",
				"View Quoted Comment Girl, my wedding is in 2 months and 13 days, FH is in New York, I work in California, so trust me when I say I 100% understand the anxiety.",
				"Lists. Checking things off as I go. I have to remind myself of the tricks I learned in CBT. Also, making sure I keep up my sleep routine, drink lots of water and eat well. When I really start to get wrapped up in worry I remind myself we can elope it gets too stressful.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yes, lists are my life.Definitely good reminders to keep up routines. Unfortunately, an elopements is not an options for us As we get closer to the day I just feel my stress level elevating, even with all my coping mechanisms in place.",
				"View Quoted Comment If you find yourself getting panicky, close your eyes and pick a color. Open your eyes and name five things that color you see around you. For example, green. Look around, and say the names of what you see \u201ccouch. shoes. Coffee mug. pillow. purse.\u201d It can help pull you back, esp if you are on the edge of a panick attack.",
				"I'm using the task list in the weddingwire app (tailored to my wedding timeline and goals) and a giant excel spreadsheet to keep track of my research on venues/vendors and other details. I try to focus only on the task at hand to avoid getting overwhelmed by everything that needs to be done. And when I do get overwhelmed, I take a break for a week or so until I have it back in me.",
				"Lists and a paper wedding planner that I can write help me focus and not get as overwhelmed. I have to take days off planning entirely so I don't get stressed by details that won't matter to anyone else but me. Self care when you are feeling stressed is even more important. I only talk with my FH about wedding planning one day a week so I don't just bombard him with ideas and questions all the time. The occasional quick question is fine but I save the rest for later. When COVID hit I had just started planning and I delayed the wedding by a year and put a full hold on everything except for finding inspiration pictures. That lasted from April 2020 to Feb 2021, when I was one month out from our date. Everyone is different so you just have to figure out what works best for you.",
				"Schedule time when the wedding isn\u2019t a priority. Maybe that\u2019s just ten minutes when you do something that isn\u2019t wedding planning. I know it\u2019s difficult since it\u2019s so close, but maybe take a walk with someone and let them know \u201cthis is ten minutes when I don\u2019t want to talk about wedding stuff\u201d and talk about ANYTHING else. Definitely lists. Write down everything that HAS to get done. Major things- people need to be paid. Wedding dress needs to be picked up. Then write down things the wedding would still be beautiful and perfect without. \u201cThe wedding would still be beautiful if I forgot the ring bearer pillow\u201d (which I did for my first wedding). \u201cThe wedding would still be beautiful if mg husbands shoes didn\u2019t fit\u201d. Things like that. accept that things might go wrong and allow yourself the space to accept them. Meditate. Breathe. Drink a ton of water. Find healthy snacks go go to when you feel the need to start snacking out of anxiety. Don\u2019t mess up your sleep schedule.",
				"When i was planning, i made sure to take breaks!",
				"I try to remind myself it\u2019s just one day and most people won\u2019t even notice the things I\u2019m worried about. Having lists and timelines to get things done definitely helps. Also, my FH takes me out on date night every Friday to get me to relax. If I start talking wedding, school, or work he navigates the conversation to something that won\u2019t stress me out. I saw you said your FH is in NY and you are in CA so maybe a Skype/FaceTime movie night?",
				"My anxiety has been really bad since our original plan kinda fell apart so I\u02bbm tryna book everything I can early as I can and check things off, feel like I\u02bbm getting things done/fixing things",
				"Plan wedding-free days where you don't allow yourself to talk about, research, check things off your list, or actively plan the wedding. Stuff will pop into your brain so jot it down on a piece of paper, but don't take action until your wedding-free period is over. If a whole day feels overwhelming, start with just a few hours at a time. Establishing those healthy boundaries of work time, family time, wedding planning time, fiance time, etc really helped my mental health and efficiency when I was ready to tackle wedding related tasks. I'm just over a month away from my wedding and it was pretty stressful at times, especially the things I couldn't control (multiple vendors cancelling and feeling like I had to do everything twice and my dress coming in late.). Overall, I'm feeling very confident that things will come out really well. I used a scaffolding model metaphor for DIY party planning and got all the major items handled in the first few months (venue, dress, bakery, caterer, flowers, rentals, officant, dj, photographer, etc) and then have spent the rest of the time working out smaller details that just add character.",
				"I actually kind of enjoy wedding planning. We planned most of our wedding prior to Covid and for the most part it was pretty enjoyable and non-stressful before Covid hit. We ended up canceling our wedding after we had already sent out invitations, eloped on our original date, and are now having our wedding celebration this year. It has been very weird to pick up planning after a full year on pause. And in the time between Covid erupting, us deciding to cancel, eloping, and then feeling really disappointed about it, I went to therapy because I was in a really bad funk I could not get myself out of (I usually have pretty good coping strategies but was completely overwhelmed when Covid derailed the plans we had for our future and our family planning timeline). There are things that stress me out here and there and what I try to do is check myself and ask \"how much does this REALLY matter?\" particularly when I just feel stuck and unable to problem solve. Some things I've spent a lot of time on really are not all that important. Like I've been debating getting a second dress (hubby already saw my dress for our elopement) and its not going to make or break our day either way. Same thing with doing my own hair, the few VIP guests who aren't coming, or the fact that our cocktail hour isn't going to be traditional because our caterer doesn't feel like passed hors d'oeuvres are appropriate during the time of Covid. It is what it is, and something being less than perfect only has the power to ruin our day if we let it. Maybe its because we went through the whole Covid thing for our elopement and it was really disappointing, but I'm trying to consciously check my emotions and way of thinking if I feel like I am getting into a negative space. I can easily get hung up on these miniscule details and there is a lot of power in just letting go, especially over the things that are insignificant or that I simply have no control over.",
				"Not well. LolI feel like I am sitting in a wedding-related anxiety puddle. I'm ready for the day after the wedding at this point.",
				"Tons of lists. All over. I will make a list & make it again a week later LOLBut honestly, the BEST thing I have done for myself are mental health breaks. Literally, It has become a thing in ALL the group texts. I am constantly being bombarded with questions by bridal party, FH family, My family etc. It has now become normal for me to say \"I will get back to you on that in one week, I am currently on a mental health break from wedding planning.\" It is THE BEST reality check & brain rest. It allows me to take a step back & actually enjoy the journey AND my fiance, HELLO date nights! I have also decided to take a break from all of my social medias. I don't have time to continuously update my feeds & stories & then engage with people & all of their questions. The people that matter, have your numbers & will reach out if/when needed. Hope this helps! Also, it's okay to have a glass of wine, take a bath & have a cry sesh lol. Wedding planning is fun but draining. Feel all the feels & keep moving",
				"I need to manage my anxiety",
				"Honestly, I finally started taking a low-dose SSRI a few months ago and it\u2019s been a complete game changer. I also meditate every day and have found ghat when I\u2019m on the very of an attack, going for a walk or playing with my dog really helps me refocus. I think the key is trying to figure out what triggers you and what things make you blissfully happy (for me, it\u2019s a fluffy puppy haha)."

I use a gentle exfoliant in the shower (I switched to a gentle one that exfoliates with chemicals rather than hard shells like St. Ives at the recommendation of the woman who gave me a facial last month), I've been getting monthly facials (microderm 2 months ago too), I use a toner in the mornings, a hyaluronic acid lotion at night for dry skin, and I wash our sheets at least once a week if not more. I've also stopped drinking anything other than water during the week, and I do eat quite healthy 90% of the time. I've gone to two dermatologists & my primary, they prescribed retinA & a face wash (tried it for 6 months, no progress) so started leaning more on medical spas.

I always feel like an infomercial when I talk about it, but I\u2019m really passionate because it\u2019s helped me with so much more than just my complexion, but that\u2019s for another post. They post tons of before and after pics on their Instagram and you can also see reviews on their website.",

				"Not sure there is much to be done for the scarring, but for ongoing breakouts, have you tried a hormonal birth control? That might do the trick.",
				"View Quoted Comment I grew up with cystic acne, and took accutane in high school which helped with a lot. I took the depo birth control shot for a few months and it's like a lot of my acne came back. Not cystic still, but the normal acne (that sucked since I had figured out how to get it go away). So they are supplements? Which ones do you take? I'm hesitant to add a ton of supplements, I already take a pre-natal & a biotin collagen hair supplement. I know biotin can cause acne so I'm considering stopping that though.",
				"I also go to a dermatologist. Retinoids didn't work for me at first either, but they switched me to a higher percentage and it worked better. The best thing I've ever used on my face though was a Clarisonic. It has helped with smoothing out my skin and preventing breakouts.",
				"View Quoted Comment I'm on the pill, unfortunately depo caused my acne to get way worse so I'm hesitant to change that at all or do anything more temporary than the pill!",
				"View Quoted Comment Yeah I really did try! I tried one and she did almost nothing, then I went to another 4 times in the past year, and she really wasn't willing to do more than \"try retinA once a week\" \"try retinA everyday\" \"try this face wash\" but nothing that actually helped and I was getting tired of paying copays for someone who saw me for 5 minutes and prescribed exactly what my primary did so I just ended up going to medical spas that recommended actual treatments. Clarisonic, the face brush? I actually have a face brush, I've just never used it. What do you use it with and how often do you use it?",
				"View Quoted Comment This is the one that I take. I\u2019m not huge on taking supplements either, but I figured what I\u2019m using on the outside isn\u2019t working, I needed to fix something inside. I was hesitant before trying it, but I looked into all of the ingredients and figured I would give it a shot.https://www.alaninu.com/products/essentials-balance",

				"View Quoted Comment Honestly, my skin got worse for probably two or three weeks before I saw any improvement. I know that it was my hormones trying to balance out, but it wasn\u2019t fun. After that few weeks it cleared up pretty quickly. I use neutrogena oil free face wash and Garnier micellar water twice a day and a St. Ives moisturizer once a day, I\u2019m not sure what the name is.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yeah I'm used to that, that happens after my facials. I was hoping that would happen with Curology but it's been 2 months now. I did google it and did see a lot of PCOS forums come up, but I will look into it further for me anyway!",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh my gosh, yes! Being super consistent is so important. If I miss a day of washing my face, I definitely notice a difference.I\u2019m not sure of the ingredients off the top of my head but I\u2019ll look when I get home!I rotate through the mask, microdermabrasion and pore minimizer, and vitamin c serum throughout the week. So I use each product 2-3 times per week",
				"View Quoted Comment Great, thank you!",
				"View Quoted Comment I use a generic Retin-A once a day and finacea foam twice a day. The Clarisonic face brush was very expensive but it works way better than the face brush I bought at the drug store. It vibrates very fast, so it doesn't spin at all. It literally shakes the dirt out of your skin. I use it twice a day for about a minute. Between the Clarisonic which is a very gentle exfoliator and the retina my scars from acne have started to go away.",
				"Honestly the only things that will help get rid of pitting is microneedling with PRP and/or fillers. And maybe some other procedures I don\u2019t know about. But creams and facials will do nothing for deep scars.",
				"View Quoted Comment RetinA seems to help with my breakouts after I get them, but really doesn't prevent them. I've used it as a spot treatment & all over face nightly treatment, it never helped with uneven skin, acne scarring, preventing breakouts, or blackheads. It helped with breakouts after they happened so I use it then, but I'm hoping to overall improve my skin. I'll look into Clarisonic, it is pretty expensive but it would be great if it worked!",
				"View Quoted Comment So is that what that is called, on my face? Pitting? I have been debating microneedling, but I will schedule some now. I've always been hesistant on fillers but I'll ask during my appointment!",
				"View Quoted Comment Mary Kay\u2019s acne line literally changed my life! I had been on prescription meds for years and sometimes my skin was ok but sometimes it would flare up again even with the meds. I\u2019ve been using the Mary Kay acne line religiously (twice a day every day since July) and my skin is the clearest it\u2019s been in YEARS. I still get breakouts sometimes but it\u2019s always just like 1 or 2 now....... I don\u2019t have full-on \u201cacne\u201d anymore which is a dream come true!",
				"View Quoted Comment Sign up for their emails they send out coupons periodically. It really is worth it and if you don't like it their return period is 3 months! I recommend the Mia 2 and the sensitive face brush. Good luck!",
				"View Quoted Comment Wow! Awesome! I will look into it for sure.",
				"View Quoted Comment Thanks! I just did!",
				"View Quoted Comment Yep, pitting occurs when deeper layers of skin are damaged/scarred. Any creams and serums and facials you start using will help prevent them but will do nothing for the ones you already have. Reach out to your local wellness centers and medical spas to ask about what your options are but you need something more hardcore than dermabrasion and facials. Even microneedling on its own will only do so much. I just finished a series of three microneedling with PRP treatments and it helped a lot but I still have some deep scars that need filler.",
				"Try aloe Vera masks every night or every other night. I use the aloe straight from the plant. Apply it to my face. Let it sit for about 20 min or unti it dries then rinse followed by your favorite moisturizer. Clears blemishes.. scars/dark spots.",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you, this is so helpful! I don't notice the pitting when I wear makeup so I'm not super concerned, but any progress is progress. I just made a microneedling appointment for April (I already have a facial appointment this month). Thank you!",
				"View Quoted Comment Great! I will! I haven't tried anything with aloe besides a toner, so I'll look into masks.",
				"Hi, I\u2019ve been battling acne since the age of 12, so almost 28 years now. I unfortunately had to keep trying different dermatologists over the years, who prescribed various medications (I\u2019ve literally been on everything\u2014Accutane, antibiotics, Retin-A, clyndamycine, etc). Finally, I found something that works; fingers crossed it will continue to work. I use a sulfur/sodium sulfacetamide combination topical face wash, as well as a cream that is similar. (The cream is what works best for me.) If you aren\u2019t currently seeing a dermatologist, I would highly recommend finding one, because it\u2019s really the only way you\u2019ll be able to try the widest variety of treatments.",
				"My aunt had REALLY bad cystic acne growing up, and was left with a lot of pitting. She swears by chemical peels, don\u2019t specifically know the type. All I know is that they were heavy duty but her skin is MUCH better!! I have hormonal acne, and I\u2019ve been able to help it with Lush. Angels on Bare skin for an exfoliator. I use mask of magnanimity about once to twice a week. I also like their cupcake mask. Then use Thayers rose toner and then Lush\u2019s celestial moisturizer.",
				"Spironolactone and The Ordinary line changed my skin. Physical exfoliants really stripped my moisture barrier and aggravated acne, and healing. I got prescribed Spiro initially through Curology, back when it was called PocketDerm or something. It eradicated my hormonal acne that was even resistant to the pill, within 2 months. I added in The Ordinary after following the Skincare Addiction subreddit (that place is really a gold mine for help with this sort of thing!) and it changed the surface of my skin within a month to the point that it glows even in winter. Look into their chemical exfoliants and their oils for sure.",
				"Helpful post, following!",
				"View Quoted Comment I was for 6 months, and it was pretty frustrating. I even switched to see if it was just that dermatologist. I saw no progress and the \"solutions\" were way too simple for my skin. I've had way more luck with medical spas, thank you though!",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you! I did schedule a facial this month, and microneedling in April, but I plan on doing a peel in May. I hope I see progress! So you like the Lush exfoliator better than a normal one like St. Ives?",
				"View Quoted Comment No problem! She SWEARS BY doing a full peel. I think she did two to really see a huge difference because her skin was very very bad. I\u2019m sure yours will be like new in one! I definitely like lush\u2019s exfoliator more. It\u2019s more expensive, but it\u2019s natural. You can go into their store and tell them your concerns and try out the product. If you have a bad reaction to it or it doesn\u2019t work you can come back and swap it for something else too! Just keep the receipt!",
				"View Quoted Comment I will ask my doctor about spiro, but I did try it prior to trying accutane in high school and unfortunately saw no results. Maybe my skin has changed since then! I've been on BC for years and that doesn't help. I had an esthetician tell me my skin isn't great for physical exfoliants, so to try chemical ones so I have been using a chemical exfoliant in the shower! On The Ordinary, I don't see a tab for chemical exfoliants?",
				"View Quoted Comment Awesome! I really hope it helps. I know doing monthly facials, microderm, microneedling and peels is awesome for my skin, I just wanted to do something at home to help too. I haven't tried lush products but I will order some now online! We don't have a store near me.",
				"View Quoted Comment Ah yea, The Ordinary calls chemical exfoliants \"Direct Acids.\" The AHA/BHA Peeling Solution, while strong, is pretty rad. I started using that 1x a week working up to the 10 minutes. After a week of starting off with the Buffet+HA+Rosehip or Borage+Moisturizer (The Ordinary Natural HA moisturizer in the AM, Cerave Facial PM moisturizer at night) I added in alternating days with the Glycolic Acid toner and the Lactic Acid at 5% while not using either the days I did the peel. Really, they do an excellent job.Spiro is an interesting one. Hormones can shift a lot over time; my acne started changing again in my mid/later 20s after a decade of stabilization with the pill, so it's definitely possible the nature of your acne has changed and it might respond better now.",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh, that makes way more sense! Thank you!",
				"I think you're skin looks very nice actually. I know the scarring is tough to deal with. I have some on my right cheek. It does bother me but I try not to let it get me down. I have found micro-needling to help. And I suggest going to a dermatologist. They may be able to use dermafillers to fill in the scars a bit temporarily. I had a lot of help with curology. I just kept working with them to adjust my formula. But I think you're doing everything right. Have you tried giving up dairy? Dairy can cause cystic acne, it does for me. As does the protein found in it.",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you! The picture doesn't show my blackheads around my nose or the current breakout above my lip & on my chin (on the other side). I did schedule microneedling in April, so I'm hoping that helps! It's a microspa so I'm going to ask about fillers, since I'm already getting botox in my forehead. I did try Curology for 2 months but my wedding is in July so I don't want to keep adjusting since I haven't seen any progress at all since the beginning of January. I haven't tried giving up dairy, but most my cystic acne went away with accutane! Now it's more the pitting, blackheads around my noise, and occasional breakout.",
				"I have had similar issues in the past and for me simpler routines worked wonders! I use Dr. Bronners Rose pure-castile soap and then a rose hip oil to moisturize. Within 2 weeks i saw such a huge difference!",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you! I'll look into both!",
				"I had the Clarisonic Mia 2 for a while and I loved using it but hated how I had to change the brush so often. I've since given it to FH to use for his face (the dummy was using a loofah to exfoliate his face), and I'm now using my Foreo Luna Fofo. I like that it's more hygienic, but I think the Clarisonic definitely helped me a lot more with exfoliation around the nose area and my clogged pores.I have heard about the Shea Moisture's African Black Soap doing wonders for acne, even cystic acne. Also Your Tea's Skin Magic Tea has some really good reviews.",
				"View Quoted Comment I just want to thank you for this suggestion! Since you suggested it, I've gotten 3 microneedling treatments and am going to schedule one more. The improvement is insane and I'm SO happy and wish I would have known sooner!",
				"I've suffered from severe acne since middle school and have tried a huge variety of skincare routines. I used very harsh cleansers when I was younger (lots of scrubs, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, etc.) but none of them helped. I saw improvement when I started on Accutane in college, but was only on that briefly due to general concerns my parents had about my using it.I finally committed to going to dermatologist when I started working and am now pretty much acne-free. I went through a course of Cephalexin and a course of Doxycycline initially to help start clearing it up. After hormonal testing, I was started on Orthotricyclen birth control and Spirolactone to regulate the hormones causing my acne. I also use topicals Retin-A and Clindamycin. My actual skincare routine is now super light - once my hormones were under control, my skin just stopped breaking out.",
				"View Quoted Comment Same! I had very bad cystic acne until I took accutane in high school. As I got a little older (maybe 21 or so), some of it came back but not nearly as bad. I saw huge improvements with accutane overall. The pitting was from acne prior to accutane, but microneedling has done wonders. I actually started doing microneedling & dermaplanning & facials since this post, and it's done wonders. My skin is SO much better. I've also started using hydrating products way more (I always thought acne meant I had oily skin so I had to use products to dry out my skin) since the drying products caused so much congestion in my skin. I did try Doxycycline awhile ago, it didn't work for me. I was looking more for solutions for our wedding (which I found)! I was so happy with my skin on our wedding day. We want to try for kids in the next year or so, so I don't really want to switch birth controls since I'll be going off off of it in the future anyway, but if later in the future I'm back on it I'll look into hormone testing! Thank you!",
				"View Quoted Comment It\u2019s amazing isn\u2019t it?! And I also did the same thing as you, started using products that hydrated my skin instead of drying it out! I started using Dior Intense Rescur serum a few months ago and it changed my skin over night!",
				"Https://www.alaninu.com/products/essentials-balanceTry balance! You have to take it everyday for awhile to see results and then continue it. It works wonders! Look at their reviews!",
				"View Quoted Comment I did! It helped with hormonal acne but I started getting super dizzy at night???? So I had to stop and the dizzy spells went away, so weird!",
				"View Quoted Comment I just googled that & will order it today, thanks for the suggestion!",
				"View Quoted Comment The owner of the company has made a few statements stated that\u2019s because it is quite literally balancing out your hormones. I know in the beginning of taking it I got bad headaches and sure enough a bunch of people said the same thing. But one they were getting regulated they go away. Not the most fun to deal with but i have seen the product work.",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you for telling me that! I googled it and couldn't find anything. I started getting them after a month of using them, so maybe I'll try them again but it was debilitating around 6 PM most evenings so it stopped me from doing everything I have to do when I get home from work (cook dinner, laundry, walk our dog, etc.) which isn't really an option.",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh no! Yeah that\u2019s super tough. Maybe if you took them a little later in the day that might help? But I totally get why you would stop them. Sorry that happened!! Good luck though and your skin looks really good by the way! I also get facials/ peels and I think that helps.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yeah maybe I'll email them and ask! I was taking them around 8 AM when I ate breakfast at work just because that's when it suggested. I haven't got a peel yet but microneedling, facials, dermaplanning, and microdermabrasion has been amazing!",
				"View Quoted Comment I just recently went to a new facial place as I plan on doing hopefully one facial a month and the first thing she said was \u201cyep we should do a peel\u201d!",
				"View Quoted Comment Awesome! Yeah I suggested it but my lady wanted to do an oxygen facial, dermaplanning, and botox before the wedding. I want to get a peel in the winter when I'm not in the sun so much though!",
				"View Quoted Comment I know this is an old post but Im searching the forums for ppl posting about acne. I have read all your replies, but which of your products do you think helped the most before your wedding? I have had 4 consecutive sessions of microneedling. I went on accutane 2years ago. My acne is wayy better but I would really love to be acne free for my wedding in 2 1/2mo. My dr prescribed me doxycycline and after doing research I am freaking out whether I should take it or not being that I only have 2 months left. Theres such a mix of reviews. Just looking for something else.",
				"View Quoted Comment No worries! I'm still on Wedding Wire so I get the alerts What helped the most for me was anything moisturizing. Before I went to the medical spa, I was using so many products (even prescribed by dermatologists) that were drying my skin out because I assumed my skin was oily like it was when I was younger and lived in CA. I went on accutane about 12 years ago, my acne started to come back about 5 years ago. The woman I saw took one look at my skin and told me it was super dry (we live in CO now). I started getting hydrafacials, using a hydrating cleanser & an oil cleanser, using vitamin C serum & hyarulonic acid serum, and using heavy moisturizers. It was amazing how much better my skin looked. I had very bad joint pain that ended up being chronic from accutane so I'm not interested in taking anymore medication for acne (my brother took it and had to get filler under his eyes because the skin beneath his eyes became so brittle he just looked tired all the time). I personally wouldn't start a new medication so close to the wedding. Have you seen a medical spa? Did you like the microneedling results?",
				"View Quoted Comment I have not been to a med spa yet. So far microneedling is helping with my ice pick scars and maybe slightly for my hyperpigmentation acne scars (but kinda not really? I cant say all my acne scars are gone but im sure its gotten better) The biggest improvement is in the texture of my skin, definitely getting better but still not 100%. I still get random pimples on my cheeks so I dont think its done much for my acne. However I do notice that sometimes I break out the day after microneedling and then my skin is pretty clear for a week or 2 after until I get pimples again.",
				"View Quoted Comment If you can afford to go, I would! A well-reviewed one too. I did microneedling with stem cells 3 times, then normal microneedling once. The pitting on one cheek is almost 100% gone and the other side is super improved. I didn't have any hyper-pigmentation though. You might want to look into a chemical peel! But soon, like in the next week or two. Those are really helpful with scarring & acne. I did dermaplanning right before our wedding and I loved it, my skin felt so fresh & clean & soft and my makeup went on wonderfully.It really just depends if you have dry or oily or acne-prone skin. I have super dry skin so I have a ton of acne congestion, the more hydrated my face is, the better my skin looks.",
				"View Quoted Comment How different is dermaplaning from microneedling? And maybe I will look into acne chemical peels. My skin is very oily.",
				"View Quoted Comment It's totally different! Microneedling is more for damaging current skin to cause new skin & collagen to grow and help issues like scarring. Dermaplaning is another form of exfoliation. It's basically shaving your face so you 100% get rid of peach fuzz, but also any dead skin. A lot of people do it monthly instead of facials or other types of exfoliation. My skin is dry, so the products I used probably won't work for you. I'd just develop a consistent skincare routine if you haven't already. I'd also start sleeping on a silk pillowcase, touch your face as little as possible, disinfect your phone often, and always 100% take off your makeup. Drink a lot of water too & cut unhealthy food out of your diet. Salicylic acid is good for acne (I'd obviously try a lot of these things ASAP since you don't want to introduce new products a month or less to your wedding) so maybe a good SA face wash would work for evening & night? I use Neutrogena alcohol free toner in the mornings & evenings too. Witch Hazel is another good option for toner for oily skin. A good facial cleansing brush would help too (Amazon has a ton). I think Clinique has a good acne oil mask you may want to try. Then I'd use a moisturizer for oily skin too.",
				"View Quoted Comment Ohhh okay now I can visualize dermaplaning I have read an article before. Im taking vitamins now & plan to switch to vitamins for \u201cacne\u201d by murad and I will take ur advice on pillowcase. I already use benzoyl peroxide/SA cleansers and creams. But Im wondering if I should maybe start Differin gel. And like u said, start Asap kind of. My bridal shower is on the 25th of this month so I want to make sure I plan it out to start next week or immediately after the shower.",
				"View Quoted Comment Great! I did take Balance Vitamins by Alani Nu for awhile, but they made me dizzy (my body is super sensitive to changes like that). One of my bridesmaids took them for a month or two and saw huge improvements with her cystic & hormonal acne. I still would say seeing a well reviewed medical spa would be helpful (maybe the place that did your microneedling?) just to see if a chemical peel or facial (or mixture of two things) would be good!",
				"View Quoted Comment Thanks for chatting with me! Im going to pay attention to how long my face is clear after microneedling. I usually just notice it but never actually counted the days. Maybe I can time it out To at least be clear for the wedding.",
				"I started with apostrophe over 3 months ago. I'm on an oral and use tretinoin. Hormonal acne is down to two and I barely get new pimples. Its pricey, but I'm really loving my skin.I use pond's to get makeup off. Panoxyl 4 in the morning, followed by vita c serum from The ordinary, then cetaphil spf. Night is ponds sensitive, cetaphil gentle cleanser, tretinoin and niacinamide, then cetaphil moisturizer. Seriously consider drugs. I wish I would have done so years ago.",
				"View Quoted Comment Nice! It sounds similar to Curology? Where it's a DIY system? I personally don't do well with those. I didn't even understand I had such dry skin, so I marked things like \"oily\" and \"acne prone\" instead of \"dry\" on the quizzes. So the system wasn't working well for me. After seeing a medical spa, I learned so much about my skin & was so happy to see results using the correct products. I personally don't want to take anymore oral medication, after taking accutane (which caused horrible side effects 10+ years later that haven't gone away) my views towards basically all oral medication isn't the best. But I know they do work for some people and I'm glad it works for you!",
				"View Quoted Comment It's not really a subscription service. You take pics of your face, submit them to your derm. They give you a treatment plan. They ask if you want to clear slow or fast. I wanted fast, so I did oral and topical. You don't have to do that. Every 3 months, I upload new pictures. They ask how you're liking treatment so far, etc. This second appt, we kept trentinoin script the same and upped spironolactone. You dont have to even buy the scripts they suggest. You can get your scripts in 30 or 90 day increments. They have me 3 cleanser options, 3 moisturizer options, tell me how to do am and pm. That's pretty much it",
				"View Quoted Comment That makes sense! That's similar to Curology for sure, you send them pictures of your skin then update your assigned dermatologist as you progress (every month or so). You also do 30/60/90 day options and it's usually a cleanser, moisturizer and treatment. They don't ask the slow or fast questions though. But I'm glad you like it! I feel like what I did was similar, just with my medical spa instead. I go in about once a month anyway and since they see me so often they are able to direct me towards the best products for my skin and it's really been helping. I started seeing progress around May 2019 (after seeing this medical spa for a few months). The picture I originally posted in this thread showed the pitting/scarring on my skin, and the only way to get rid of that is through things like microneedling & professional chemical peels. Cleansers & moisturizers for sure helped my skin and acne, but they won't do anything for deep scarring like I had.",
				"Well i just want to say you here that I'm on the pill, tragically depo made my skin inflammation deteriorate so I'm reluctant to change that at all or do much else brief than the pill!",
				"Struggled with acne my whole life. was even on accutane and it came back. indian healing clay mask saved my life",
				"View Quoted Comment I understand! I had horrible side effects (not acne though) with Depo. I have bad hormonal acne and the pill doesn't help it either. I'm going off birth control soon but my skin is already pretty unpredictable so I don't think much will change.",
				"View Quoted Comment I'm glad to hear that! I was on accutane about 10 years ago, it left me with horrible permanent joint pain and my acne came back around my 20th birthday. I've used indian healing clay a bunch, but didn't see much progress. I've heard great things for a lot of people though! For me, a 10+ step skincare routine morning & night, lots of masking/dermaplaning/dermarolling at home, and professional treatments once a month is pretty much required if I want to keep my acne (especially hormonal) under control.",

As I\u2019ve gotten older, my anxiety has gotten worse, so im wondering for those of you who also suffer with it, what are some things you have done/ taken to cope on an everyday scale? Natural remedies would of course be my preference. TIA!",

				"I have anxiety too, and my FH is really good about helping me calm down. He reminds me that worrying now means I am just reliving the stress over and over again. Then usually he bugs and teases me so much until I get mad at him and eventually can\u2019t help but laughing and letting some of it go. It helps me to just finish some of the things (like booking vendors, deciding on a cake or invite list) and then don\u2019t allow myself to reconsider it - the decision is made so let it go. It also helps when I say what I\u2019m worried about out loud. Literally, write down a list. Most concerns about weddings are pretty trivial when you actually think about it. Don\u2019t let yourself compound the problem and spiral, address each specific source of stress. And definitely stop stressing about Father\u2019s Day, it is literally the lowest tier of holidays and so not a big deal! \u263a\ufe0f",
				"Hi Heather! I've been seeing a therapist and have been on medication for anxiety for a long time. Still gets to me though. What has been helping me with wedding planning is first and foremost, staying organized. I used to organize ad shoots in my previous job so I just started treating the whole thing like a photoshoot - I got spreadsheets and folders galore on my google drive. I find it helps me feel more in control (even if there may be some things i CAN'T control- like this uptick in covid cases ) Also setting aside specific times where I work on planning. Like in the evening, I try not to even think about it/talk about it/work on anything and just eat dinner and watch TV with FH. In terms of natural remedies, CBD if available, can be great. I take it for pain (usually in candy or cream form) but it could help relax you too. If I had a tub, I'd probably soak in a lavender bath to relax too. Make sure you are also exercising - something as simple as walking can calm your mind down if you are feeling overwhelmed.Best of luck",
				"I have anxiety and social anxiety. The thought of not having things done before the day of and having the spotlight on me has me on edge all the time. I'm 14 days out and some days are worse than others. But my fiance trys to help calm me down. We have a weighted blanket and lavender oil for our oil diffuser. That helps take the edge off.",
				"I'm with you there... I have a panic disorder and my panic attacks cause me immense pain and GI distress, so I'm really nervous that the day of the wedding I'll be having non-stop panic attacks.My backup is taking a Xanax. A half tablet will instantly stop a panic attack while leaving me clear-headed. But I try not to rely on pills if at all possible; it makes me feel like I can't handle things without help.What helped me most was CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). It helps to break down your worries and examine whether or not the things you fear will really happen, and if they do, how bad they'd really be. Anxiety will kind of create a big scary monster, which is so scary that you can't even look at it properly to see it's actually a little mouse. In reality a lot of the worst case scenarios you fear, if you really break them down, aren't that bad. You'll get through them a bit at a time and everything will turn out okay. My therapist used to say \"If you can do something about it, don't worry; if you can't do anything about it, don't worry\" and that helps me a bit too.",
				"I\u2019ve honestly started seeing my therapist again for my anxiety and have been working with CBT techniques to help with over thinking. I initially started seeing him again bc I myself am a people pleaser and we worked on setting boundaries during the planning process which really helped. But everything that could go wrong has and altho we\u2019ve been able to problem solved and fix it, it\u2019s a lot of stress and anxiety which just adds to my overall anxiety level. It\u2019s gotten so bad I sometimes have panic attacks driving on the highway and get super anxious driving now which is super new for me, that my therapist thinks could be sympathetic symptoms (I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called) from underlying wedding stress .. as for other ways to mellow out, I give myself 30 mins a night to read which calms me and baths. I\u2019ve been working out more and trying to incorporate some meditation/breathing exercises in the evening",

My fianc\u00e9 is my anchor and knows how to handle me at my worst which is such a blessing. I drink a lot of tea which helps to calm my nerves. Also, avoiding stimulants like caffeine keeps my anxiety levels from increasing. I am also interested in hearing what others suggest as I could totally benefit from tips. I hope you find some relief for your big day.",

I am crazy type A do everything is organized on spreadsheets by color so that\u2019s already done lol. I think the CBD and the working out more will help. FH is really really supportive and helps me off the ledge every time. I am off all summer so I have a LOT of time to overthink. I think staying busy also helps control it.",
				"Thanks all for sharing! I have a lot of the same anxieties as the date gets closer. I need to start managing it better I feel - what\u2019s helped in the past is doing yoga, going on walks, journaling, anything that helps me feel more grounded and less in my head. \ud83d\udc9c",

				"Drinking a full glass of water 10-30 minutes before everything you put in your mouth suppresses appetites in a very safe way. I have never heard of a diet pill that's 100% safe. Good luck. Also, if you're drinking caffeine, gradually stop. Despite it being a stimulant, caffeine will end up making you feel tired and draggy after the initial jolt is over. As Faith is saying, exercise gives you endorphins and more energy. Just a walk around the neighborhood will help.",
				"Exercise always worked for me AND gives you more energy. Quick fixes are exactly that, a quick fix. Without a healthy diet and exercise routine the weight you lose with a pill will most likely come right back.",
				"I completely agree with both of you ladies I'm just having a tough time getting started...maybe I should just stick to the Weight Watchers",
				"I am not one for diet pills I lost 23 pounds in a year and half with diet and exercise But if you want a jump start I don't know if you heard about advocare products they have this 24 day challenge and people lose about 5 lbs on the first week of doing it. It's meal replacement shakes and a bunch of other stuff.. I take spark which is like a preform out before my lifting and running gym sessions it really helps... Idk if you are interested in that",
				"Back in 2005 I took phentermine I went from a size 14 to a size 6 in 3 months. It was certainly a quick fix! I was on a VERY strick diet also. I was monitored every 2 weeks by a doctor for blood pressure and potassium issues becasue it can cause issues. I stopped taking it once I lost so much that I didn't look healthy. I kept it off until I got pregnant with my son. I tried taking it again and it didn't work the same way. That being said, I don't advise taking it. Its not a safe way to loose weight! What the women above told you is a lot better advise. I just wanted to answer your question.",
				"Please don't take diet pills. Try the apple test: if you're about to eat something outside of a meal time bc you think you're hungry, imagine replacing what you're about to eat with an apple-- would you still eat it? If the answer is yes, then that means you're actually hungry. If the answer is no, then something other than hunger is making you want to eat (boredom, stress, thirsty, etc), and you should stop yourself from doing it.",

				"Diet pill are not safe. They mess with your hormones and your digestive system. Don't expect to loose weight quickly and be able to sustain it. Healthy weight lose is about 1-2 lbs a week. Clean eating and exercise is the only way to go. Diet: don't eat anything that comes in a box, has a commercial or has a drive thru. Don't drink any sodas- not even diet soda. Drink water, and lots of it. Eat more veggies than anything else. Exercise: just move more than you usually do. Pick something you like and you have fun with so you will stick to it. Good luck!",

				"I've tried diet pills when I was younger. (that makes me sound super old.) They never worked. Don't waste your money. If you want to take something for energy, try a multi-vitamin. I will say that I've been a yo-yo dieter for at least 10 years. I've tried every fad diet, only to gain everything back time and time again. 2 years ago I hit 178 pounds. I seriously weighed more than both my brother and father, which was a wake up call. My fiancee convinced me to try weight watchers. I lost 8 pound in the first month with just diet. I started going to the gym 3 days a week (2 days of Zumba and 1 additonal work out day). By the end of month 3 I weighed 152 pounds. Now, 2 years later, weight watchers has taught me to eat healthy and portion control and I am able to actually maintain my weight for the first time in over 10 years. I want to lose 10 pounds before the wedding and I actaully know that my goal is achievable with the help of weight watchers. (I should totally be a spokewoman!)",
				"I did Advocare 24 day challenge last year in June. I definitely helped cleanse my body. I didn't lose the crazy amounts that others \"say\" they did. I did lose a few inches...of water weight. I also did it exactly the way it says to and incorporated diet. I am not a fan of \"diet Pills\" they are not good for you in anyway shape of form. and trust me I have thought of doing it but my FH highly disagrees and makes it known. We both are just eating better and working out daily. Even if it is just a walk around the block. I also had a really great group of friends at work and we would walk around the building when it was warmer and do stairs everyday. Just find something that will motivate you...and stick with it.",
				"I was on one. Made me feel great for a few days.. Was drinking tons of water eating good walking. Then I almost ended up in the hospital. It races your system up, can slow down kidney functions and just isn't good. They make vitamins that can boost metabolism and such maybe check those out since they aren't bad for you. All I know is that diet pill was the scariest thing I ever did my body hated it!",
				"I've used diet pills, and they worked, but they don't sustain you. If you want to jump start your weight loss, cut out carbs. Legit, no bread, potatoes, pasta, sweets. Lean proteins, leafy veggies. The weight will come off relatively quickly.",

I'm not planning on staying on it forever. Wedding is in 18 days and I started taking the pills January 1. It gives you energy but doesn't make me jittery. I have lost 2 sizes since I started.",

				"@Catera did you put all the weight back on quickly though? I don't diet and I never really have but I made a commitment to being active when I was in college. I make time to work out at least 5 days a week with a goal of 30 minutes a day. I eat what I want in moderation and watch my portions as much as possible. I train for long distance runs so usually from March-May, I'm running 30+miles a week. That is when I'm eating like a boy hitting puberty crossed with a woman pregnant with triplets. I've managed to stay the same weight for almost 6 years by being in tune with what my body wants/needs. Do not use diet pills, you'll lose weight quickly just to gain it back.",
				"I have taken a certain brand of diet pills before, but I was also eating well and working out. I stopped, ate like shit and ballooned up to a horrible size. Fast forward 6 years ... I have began taking those same diet pills again. I started them last week. I cut out all fast food, fried food, soda, drinking more water again and working out. I have already gone from 186 to 182.5 in a week. It's not just the pills, it's a combo of also working on getting healthy again. If you do decide to use diet pills, do a lot of research. Read all the reviews. I am only using what I've used before because I know it works for me. Every one responds differently to whatever is in pills. Proceed with caution.",

				"I use advocare!! I love it. It is created by surgeons who wanted to help their patients get the daily recommended nutrients and vitamins as well as help with weightloss, natural energy, and overall better health. I use thermoplus 2 times a day (before breakfast and dinner). I also do a 10 day herbal cleanse from advocare 2-3 times a year. It is a great product https://www.advocare.com/120431997/Store/default.aspx check out the store, not only do I use it, but I am a distributor. Feel free to message me with any questions! Sometimes you just need help when eating correctly and exercising. We all have different bodies and sometimes the extra helps with what results we want. Good luck",
				"I used diet pills and they worked - at first. The weight came back because I was just losing water weight. I don't even want to know what I did to my body during that time. Please don't use diet pills. The only people they \"work\" for are the manufacturers making $$ off you. Exercise and eat healthy!",
				"Diet & nutrition are very important! Use a good online tool like My Fitness Pal to keep within your daily calorie intake. Most importantly, exercise... lift weights, challenge yourself everytime to lift heavier. That mixed with some cardio.. I promise, you will see results. Lifting is the key! Good luck! No pills, please!",
				"Yeah yeah, we all know diet pills aren't good for you. But like you, I want to lose weight fast and I need help. I have been taking pure garcinia cambogia for about a month and half and lost 2 freaking lbs. So I definitely don't recommend that. My friend lost a ton of weight taking phen. I haven't had any great success stories from any diet pills, so that's why I opened this thread!",
				"I have never heard of a diet pill actually working. However, I have had two sets of friends that recently lost a ton of weight. One is christian, and she did the Daniel Fast (http://danielfast.wordpress.com/). The only reason I like this fast is because it isn't really a fast- it's basically only eating frutis, veggies and nuts. My friend has lost 20 pounds in a month. I was concerned about her gaining it all back since she lost it so quickly, but she has decided to keep eating that way, even after the fast ended. Two of my guy friends have been doing these video sets called T25 by beach body. One did it with no diet and after a couple months he has lost 20 lbs, and the other has been doing it with a restrictive diet and has lost 50 lbs.",
				"I actually have an appointment for next week to go to my Dr. for this. I have been on them before they do help! It gives you the appetite suppression and energy you need to help lose weight and if your not doing your part your dr. Will take you off of them.You still have to be motivated to do your part working out and eating healthy.",

				"Kat! If that doesn't deter usage, I don't know what will!",
				"Take a look at your diet and try to figure out what's causing you to not have energy. For some people, it's carbs, and upping your protein will help a ton. Or try adding a multivitamin. Seriously--a few months ago, I started regularly taking a multi and found myself with a ton of more energy. My body must have needed *something* but who knows what. Diet pills just aren't worth it. I am by no means a purist about what I put in my body, but I would not take the risk of diet pills. I have heard great things about Advocare, but that's more of an energy or workout supplement I think. If that's what you're looking for, do your research on the ingredients and go for it!",
				"I have tried almost everything! I took adipex and lost over 50 lbs in 3 months. I looked amazing but when I couldn't afford to go to the doctor and get more I gained all the weight back and then some! So I am battling my weight again but I'm doing it with herbalife shakes and the total control pills and I absolutely love it and feel better than ever. I've only been doing it for a couple weeks and have lost almost 6 pounds.",
				"I do not recommend diet pills. Drink water, watch what you eat, and exercise. Lose weight the healthy way. Diet pills may help you lose the weight, but more than likely you'll just gain it back. Plus, people tend to get lazy when they start taking diet pills (I see this all the time at work) and then they expect the pills to do all of the work for them. You have to stay healthy and active for anything to work at all. Workout supplements or supplements that may assist you in losing the weight would be much better to take than an actual diet pill. Multivitamins are good to take as well. Plus, like Kat mentioned, they usually have terrible side effects. Jim - Phentermine is a controlled prescription substance. It can only be prescribed by a physician and they normally have to monitor you closely while you're on it since it can mess with your organs. It also does not work right away for many people. I have patients who have been on it for close to a year and they don't look any smaller.",

				"A few tips: - Drink green tea (it speeds up your metabolism and is good for you) - If you're hungry then try drinking water first and then only eat something if you're still hungry (it's easy to confuse thirst with hunger) - Ditch the car if you can. Even catching public transport is better for you as you're forced to walk to the bus stop.",
				"This message for everyone who's trying to take Phentermine or Adipex P. You are putting your health in danger. The reason why you need a prescription is because, #1 it is addictive, you are basically taking speed, similar as sold on the streets, #2 it is destroying your heart valves. Doctors are not telling you that, because they want to make money!!! Stay away from Phentermine. What you need is a supplement, but not herbal. You need nutraceuticals - natural pharmaceuticals. The best ingredient that's sold without prescription is Phenylethylamine or PEA. I happen to know product called PhenObestin 37.5 that works just as well for weight loss as Phentermine and Adipex, but a lot less dangerous. Trust me. I know thing or two about medicine...",
				"I think it can't work. Try some diet.",
				"If anyone is thinking of using diet pills please Do Not. They will only get rid of water weight and most of the time when you stop using them you may actually put on more weight then you had in the beginning. The best and healthiest way to lose weight is to eat right and to exercise. At home workout programs are very helpful in this regard as they have a calendar/schedule that helps keep you on track and motivated. They also come with meal plans so you can learn how to eat healthy as you are working out. There are no shortcuts to losing weight properly and healthily.",

I sell ItWorks! and I personally take what we call triple threat. which is Thermofit(Pills), Fat Fighters(pills) and Greens(powder). and I've REALLY seen a difference. In 3 months I've personally lost 55lbs with healthy eating, low exercise and these products. I some what fell off with taking them, so I'm starting to work out more and use these products ! They are not to replace working out and healthy eating, they just give your body a boost",

I didn't experience any nasty side effects, nothing I couldn't handle anyway. It has been really easy. By the way, I bought my pills here: weightlossproducts.club ...a reliable and safe source",
				"Garcinia Cambogia will definitely kick start you metabolism and give you lots of energy. I have not taken it regularly, but when I do take it I can definitely feel the energy kick. The down side for me is that it makes me really hungry all day so make sure to have healthy snacks. I also try and drink green tea every day which is supposed to boost metabolism also.",

I've been doing some light weightlifting and a lot of stationary biking to work on my stamina and muscle tone! There's definitely the added bonus of having more toned arms/back in my sleeveless and low-back dress \ud83d\ude02 But like you, my motivation is mostly health-driven and wanting to feel good on my big day, not by a desire to look a certain way!",
				"Oh heck yeah! Feeling good and getting energy back is SUCH a huge plus.I'm down almost 15lbs. from the beginning of the year, and want to lose 25 more before our wedding next March (I've got time), but losing 30 would be the real goal!I've been with my partner for almost 8 years now and within that time I've gained 45lbs, so I want to get back to being healthy (it was a lot of build up of stress, overworking, stress eating as a result, not exercising, not eating super healthy all the time either, etc.)I'm still trying to get re-motivated; in January I was working out Mon-Fri at home and eating well, though I've fallen off slightly on the working out since work got busy, but I know I can do this. When I was working out and eating well in Jan and Feb, I was sleeping better and had so much more energy. Sometimes it's hard to stay motivated even when I know doing all those things makes me actually physically and mentally feel better.",

				"I am also just eating healthy and exercising when I can. One of the main health goals I have had for myself other than just diet/exercise is my skin. I have a thoroughly researched skincare regimen now that has made my skin look and feel the best it ever has. I want my skin to look great and not require too much concealing or cover up on the day. What I told my wedding day MUA, LESS IS MORE. I definitely would just like my natural features enhanced and any blemishes covered up but I still want to look like myself and not have too much make up on."

It might also be frowned upon if you are sat on or near the children's table. But for the most part, you should be ok as long as you ask the wedding party and check that it's ok to vape inside the venue. If you can't vape inside, then find a quiet vape patch outside.

				"My recommendation is a dermatologist! Everyone's skin is different and requires specialized care. It may take time for your skin to clear up but in the long you will be thankful. Also, my dermatologist suggests (in general) washing simply with Dove unscented soap (the bar) as it is as basic as it gets and will not irritate the skin. (Nothing with \"beads\" to exfoliate, etc.) And *sigh* as tempting as it can be sometimes, try not to pick at it, and don't load on the make-up so that that your skin can breath and heal",
				"Cut out sugar.",

I go about every 9 weeks (super oily skin and pimple prone) and my skin looks awful for about a week after. But, it's so so worth it. For reference, my last facial will be 2.5 weeks before my wedding.",
				"I agree with PP. See a dermatologist. I tried every over the counter product but none worked. Turns out it was hormonal. Fixed that and I\u2019ve had clear skin for 2.5 years. Your dermatologist will be able to diagnose your problem and prescribe the right course of treatment. Until then, use a gentle cleanser like cetaphil, skip the toner and creams, and use s light moisturizer that\u2019s noncomodegenic.",
				"When I had to stop eating dairy for other reasons, my skin cleared up. I also discovered the products I was using to treat acne were actually making it worse. That being said, everyone's bodies process things differently. I'd try a dermatologist or even a general practitioner to talk about what may be best for your situation.",
				"Try a dermatologist though it\u2019s important to get a good one so ask around. I had a few over the years that did a lot of topical creams and antibiotics, neither of which did much (aside from increase the potential for yeast infections!) it depends on the level of acne too. For my recent minor outbreaks in the last few years (not horrible cystic acne that is widespread, as I\u2019ve had in the past), I have had success with Mario Badescu buffering lotion and drying cream. People rave about the drying lotion but I didn\u2019t find it helpful. I second the gentle cleanser approach. Cetaphil or purpose are other good ones. My acne has subsided a lot....probably due to getting older! I\u2019m over 40 now.",
				"Acne is very different for everyone which is why seeing a derm is very important. Nothing topical works for me because my acne is all driven by my hormones. I eat the healthiest diet, a gallon of water a day.... it won\u2019t change a thing. I was put on spironolactone and it was a god send. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s worked for me.",

I went back 2 years later, so last year, and now after years of adult acne and trying everything, my skin is clear.",

And cetaphil foam soap has also been working the best as far washing my face. And I finally am starting to get control of it and it\u2019s going away along with blemishes and acne scars.",
				"My regular doctor has been treating my acne for now. She's given me a prescription topical medication to get me to the wedding, and it's working well.

I never pushed myself, I just do what is comfortable, but I do something, even if it's only down dog or 20 squats so that I stay in the routine. Now I've switched to a great app, Fit On. I really like that I can choose from hundreds of different exercises and difficult levels. Plus some only last 5 minutes. They even have meditation. Anyway, I've been getting stronger and my back pain has subsided. The app doesn't make me feel bad for not keeping up or being terribly uncoordinated \ud83d\ude06.

Lost 15lbs at tge end of it. Remember with losing weight, it's more about WHAT YOU EAT!!! I ate mostly veggies, grilled chicken and fish. Got rid of all sweets. Never dreak anything except water. Whenever I had sweet tooth, I would drive to fast food place to get a scoop of icream or something. Weight loss is all about DISCIPLINE",

Popsugar fitness on youtube also has great workouts that I've used!!I don't encourage looking at a scale everyday. It's always discouraged me when I see little progress. If anything, I weigh myself once a week to keep myself in check of where I'm at, BUT I don't let that number define me. I measure my weight loss more by how my clothes fit. Visibly you can tell I've lost weight and toned up, but the scale doesn't reflect that. Muscle is more dense than fat, so even though the # hasn't changed much, I can tell by looking at myself that I def. have!",

				"It definitely sounds like you've had a lot of stressful things to cope with. From my understanding of dieting, it doesn't work for the long term. And your body will only work harder to try to store the fat after if you deprive yourself. Dieting can also add to the stress you're already dealing with and stress hurts our bodies more. It may be helpful to consider intuitive eating. This can also contribute to finding foods that work for your acid reflux. I know a great RD that helps women with IE: @no.more.guiltI think we all deserve to enjoy food and appreciate how our body works to take care of us.I also love the suggestions to try some yoga and self care routines.

				"Fasting is not for me",
				"No fad diets, no cutting out whole food groups such as carbs (carbs are what give you energy). It\u2019s not going to do you much good as statistics show these methods typically work short term (believe me, I have a lot of years trying out different methods). What does work: strength training 3-4x a week, cardio 1-2 days, eating foods in whole form (fruits, veggies, lean meats, brown rice, oats, healthy fats like olive oil and nuts, etc). Eat balanced meals (carbs, protein, healthy fat) until you\u2019re satisfied and eat consistently. Don\u2019t starve yourself, you will end up binging. Reduce white sugar and cut out as much alcohol as possible.",
				"I second (third?) weight watchers. It wasn't for the wedding, but I did it for about 6 months last year and lost 15 kg and it wasn't even hard, the recipes in the app are super tasty. The moment you get over having to cut out bread and eat it more a like a treat, it gets really easy. Also, most importantly, the weight has not returned because I've gradually switched to healthier eating habits and didn't even have to think about keeping them, it just happened. I didn't need the group or anything, just got the app.",
				"I've tried to ease into healthier eating habits, and am getting progressively stricter with my nutrition as I get closer to the date (now about four weeks out). Current challenge is cutting alcohol intake to near-zero, limiting carbs to earlier in the day, and avoiding sugar and fried foods. It has gotten easier with time, which hopefully means the final stretch and even more focused pre-wedding nutrition will be doable!",

I don\u2019t know what to do in order to hold myself accountable or to motivate myself, I figured the wedding would be enough but it\u2019s not doing the trick.",
				"You could always talk to a nutritionist to find out the right types of foods to eat for your body type. The issues is not cutting out carbs 100%, or drinking only water all the time. But to find out what changes you need to make in your food choices and add some activity daily. Every little bit of movement counts and helps you burn calories. They say calorie counting doe snot, work however it is the best way to portion the amount of food you each at each meal. All these lovely ladies have wonderful ideas that have worked for them, however not every way works for others. Key to losing weight is finding what has worked for you in the past and revisiting that past success and revamp it based on age. Some people have better luck losing weight by food restrictions, others do best with working out. research a nutritionist that can do test on your body type and give to list of foods to eat and avoid based on your body type and age. I personally have been cutting down on the amount of carbs I eat in each meal and Have been utilizing kick boxing for work out. We also have a VR system for the PS4 and have download beat saber and VR boxing game, these make working out a breeze and its fun.",

Just My Experience, Hope It Helps.",
				"The only sustainable way is by making changes that you can keep up with. Don't do any fad diets or use any pills. Losing weight is only possible by taking in fewer calories than you are burning.I workout 3-4 times per week and eat healthy most of the time. I have no \"off limits\" foods because if I tell myself \"no ice cream, cheeseburgers, tacos, etc\" I will end up eating way more of them when I finally give in. Cutting out soda worked well for me because it wasn't something I felt the need to drink.I meal prep my lunches, snacks, and dinners to avoid temptation to go out to eat, but still allow myself to eat pizza, tacos, etc every once in a while. The key to that is eating those \"unhealthy\" foods in moderation on a day that you have worked out so it isn't detrimental to your progress! Making those foods at home can also make them healthier than restaurant options.Weight loss is more of a lifestyle change than something that happens quickly. Remember, the progress will be gradual because losing 1 pound takes a 3500 calorie deficit. Don't get discouraged because that deficit takes time to achieve! And make sure you calculate your BMR to be sure you are giving your body the essential calorie intake it needs to function. You can look up BMR calculators online to give you a general idea of how many calories you should be eating in a day.",

				"I've been waxing monthly for years. It's really not that painful once you get used to the feeling, but the first few times can be rough. I definitely recommend trying it for the first time well before your wedding to make sure you respond well to it. Like for example, my legs get really red and they stay red for about 24 hours after I get waxed. They also feel extremely sensitive to the touch, and the pores will be open that day too (meaning, you really want to wear something like leggings or yoga pants that are soft on your sensitive legs, but also provide coverage of your legs so the pores won't get infected).So just do it once to see how you respond to it. Also to see how long it lasts for you. I have pretty fast-growing hair so for me it looks perfect during week 1, mostly perfect during week 2 (there will be some patches by then but only if you look closely), eh by week 3 (like you can see some hair but it's not bad), and then i need to get it done again by week 4.I did my waxing on Thursday before my Sunday wedding because I knew I'd be red on Friday and then good by our rehearsal dinner on Saturday",

I've known my wax lady for years so usually I'll just chat with her and that's distracting enough, but if not then if you even have a mindless game or something to watch on your phone that can help. Like if you just lay there thinking about it, it's going to hurt a lot more than if you can take your mind off it haha.",

Weight watchers is more sustainable long term but Jenny Craig is very very easy- they tell you what to eat and when. Wedding planning is hard and stressful which for me often leads to making poor decisions food wise. I was 163 and wanted to lose 10-15lbs for my wedding and recognized that my food options were where I was failing. Other options are using MyFitnessPal which really helps you account for calories and exercise. And Peloton is great for workouts, even without a bike. They have cardio, barre, free running, strength training. And it\u2019s only $13/month if you don\u2019t have a bike or tread. Consistency is key 20-30 minutes a day. You can do it!!",

				"Weight watchers (the app) worked wonders for me! Way better than a fad diet, although it does take longer, but it also teaches you healthy eating habits. Even after I've cancelled the programme, I have kept them and I haven't gained that weight back (which happened almost immediately after I've tried keto or other diets). The point system is so simple, in that all the calories and makros are already weighted in and you don't have to sit there calculating proteins and carbohydrates... So yeah, it may take longer depending on how quickly you adapt, but it lasts and I can definitely say that I've never gone hungry.I also started moving more after losing all that weight, first at the gym, but then they got closed because of COVID and I've discovered popsugar fitness on YouTube, the videos are fun and there's a huge variety. My favourite trainer is probably Jake Dupree.",

Drink a lot of water, watch your salt intake, focus on veggies and protein. But if it's \"my wedding is in a year and I want to feel more confident and be healthier\" then definitely take a look at Weight Watchers or Noom or something else focused on building those habits in a safe and lasting way! (though, honestly, these are great resources all the time and I recommend looking into them anyway!) I've been doing a lot of research around intuitive eating and calorie deficits and have been tracking calories with My Fitness Pal!",
				"Food takes on a big role for losing weight. While I didn't get to workout to look as toned as I wanted to before my wedding, I at least made sure to eat right. No junk food especially (chips, cookies, ice cream, fast food, etc). I definitely watched my salt and sugar intake as well. I made sure to eat as many home made meals as I could since I was able to moderate what goes into it. If you can meal prep for the week that would help sooo much! It definitely helped me and my husband.As for working out it depends on how much you are trying to lose and what areas you want to work on especially. So, give yourself a schedule and a timeline and set some goals so you know what you need to do weekly. There are a lot of at home workouts you can do if you look on youtube or even pinterest",

If you pick that one, you'll see results in about a week, then it'll plateau for a couple weeks, and right around the time the second months starts, you'll start seeing yourself leaner and stronger all over.

				"This is very hard to predict because everyone's body reacts different to coming off birth control. I came off birth control a week before my wedding and went months without a period. I went to the doctor and found out I have PCOS which explained the missed periods. I never had issues prior to birth control so this was definitely not expected. I had to be put on medication to kick start my period then once that resumes I was prescribed medication to help make sure I was ovulating. It ended up taking us a year to conceive. I had no idea it would be so difficult. While that is my experience, it could be completely different for you. You might have an extremely easy time or you might have a difficult time. It all depends on how your body responds.",
				"I got my merania removed June 2019 got pregnant in July 2019",
				"I would talk to your doctor only because each birth control is different and it works different on every body. I would ask for their suggestion",
				"I would discuss this with your OB/GYN. They will have the best answer for you.",
				"Surely your doctor will know better, but then it all depends on a woman ;-) Some wait 1 month, some... more than 2 years ;-)",
				"You never know how long it will take your body to regulate after birth control & it\u2019s possible it may take time to get pregnant. Even though you have a timeline for what you want, try not to add pressure to it. You can remove it a month before but not everyone gets pregnant right away.",
				"Your doctor would know best. When the time comes for me I plan on talking to my doctor before I change anything.",
				"Like everyone else said, how long it will take to get pregnant depends on your specific body. However, I've been reading/thinking about this a lot recently (I just made an appointment to have my beloved Kyleena removed) and it is possible to get pregnant within a month (or less) of having a hormonal IUD removed. I would say that when you should have it taken out depends on how much of a rush you're in (would you be upset if you weren't pregnant by February or March?) and how you'd feel about getting pregnant before your wedding (would that be a problem for you?) If you have it taken out in November, you definitely wouldn't have a positive test before the wedding, but there's no guarantee you'll get pregnant right away. If you had it removed next week, there's a higher chance you'd be pregnant by January, but there's also a chance of it happening earlier than you might be prepared for.",
				"Everyone has a different timeline of how long the artificial hormones take to leave the body. It could take a month, three, six etc. Definitely make an appointment with your doctor for their professional opinion. I went off the pill in April for my June 21 wedding. I wanted to have 2-3 months off it prior to trying.",
				"I'll echo what others have said about everyone being different and talking to your doctor about it. I would also caution getting it out close your wedding date because you don't know how your skin will react and a lot of people get hormonal acne flare ups when they come off hormonal BC.",
				"You should talk to your doctor.One option to consider beforehand would be switching from Mirena (hormonal IUD) to Paraguard (copper IUD). The copper one has no hormones so does not impact your cycles in the same way hormonal methods of birth control do, meaning you can get pregnant right away once it is removed.In your shoes I would honestly just have the Mirena taken out immediately before or after the wedding and see what happens. There is no guarantee you will get pregnant right anyway, even if you were using non-hormonal contraception anyway. Some couples conceive first go, for others it takes years.But speak with your doc so you know all your options.",
				"Talk to your doctor because everyone's body is different. I went off BC and got my period within a month. My brothers girlfriend went off at the same time and it took her over 6 months to have a period. Your doctor is the only one who is going to know or have solid advice on this."

Any changes you are looking to make to your body are healthier by going to the gym or eating a balanced diet. I will say one thing that is different, what is balanced for one person, is not the same for the other - don't follow diets just because someone else had success. Find a nutritionist who will work with you - the one I have never once mentioned I needed to eat salad - I hate salad, I've tried to like it all my life, and it's a waste of time and money to try and eat it.

				"I did it. it works.... its not cheap..and the number of sessions you need depends on how much extra fat you have.. it cost roughly $600 per area per session, one session would get rid of about 20-30% fat cells in the area... so you might see good results if your 'extra' is not a whole lot and you already maintain a healthy lifestyle, not a good option for folks with lots of weight to lose.

I've found that for my students, giving them a 10-minute or less workout makes them more apt to do something vs nothing.",

People hold weight differently, and it is not possible to lose weight from one area but not others.Having said that, you can definitely do arm exercises that will help tone your arms. I'd recommend some triceps exercises (look up triceps kick-backs, dips, and skull crushers) because having a nice tricep really helps give the arm definition and look less flabby or bulky. In general, you want to train opposing muscle groups - so if you do pushing exercises (like push-ups, bench presses, or overhead presses), you should do pulling exercises as well (pull-ups or incline/supported pull-ups, bent-over or upright rows, reverse flies), and if you do triceps exercises you should do biceps as well (biceps curls, hammer curls). I also love doing shoulder circuits with light weights for toning your shoulders, which helps provide balance and symmetry for your arms.Swimming is also great for toning your arms.",

I mean my arms look pretty fit, bit not \"full of muscles\", which is super important for me. And also it doesn't require tons of time, which is also essential since I have a 2 years old... My fav video to workout is the one down here. It\u00b4s not very easy, but doing those 12 mins just once or twice a week gives FIRE RESULTS!! So its 100% recommended to get a set of mini bands in amazon (great quality!). Hope it was helpful Good luck ladies!!"

I would likewise prefer to lose that amount and my wedding is also that many days away, and honestly, with the amount I eat currently and how much I exercise... I don't think it's possible *for me*. But it depends how severe you're prepared to be with yourself! I eat really well during the week and only have alcohol or takeout on the weekends. I know those treats I have on the weekends are what makes it difficult for me to lose the last little bit of weight I want, but I also don't really want to make the sacrifice I'd need to in order to do so. It would just be too depressing to live that way, even if it was only for 70 days.",
				"Depending on your current weight and lifestyle adjustments, it will be difficult but not impossible. That said, it\u2019s most important to do this the healthiest way possible. I recommend looking into the Whole 30 diet - it\u2019s 30 days quite extreme cuts but no caloric limitation just cutting a lot of sugar/processed food. On a much less extreme note, cut out drinking anything except for water and black coffee. No drinking calories. No artificial sweetener. Water and coffee. Also - exercise!! Not just a bunch of cardio. Do push-ups and sit-ups every single night. It isn\u2019t only losing weight - gaining muscle will help you look leaner and feel confident. Push-ups, sit-ups, planks during commercials at night and set goals and improve.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yes, this is what I mean! I've already done all those things, so there's not much more I can cut.

				"The generally acceptable amount of weight to lose per week is 0.5-2 lbs. I've been on a weight loss/health/fitness journey for a little over a year now, and I would say at my most dedicated (~24% calorie deficit, >10,000 steps a day, moderate cardio workouts 2-4 x a week) I was losing about 1.25 lbs a week. With your timeline, it is certainly possible to lose that much, but it may not be enjoyable or sustainable. To lose weight you must be in a caloric deficit, so you'll need to figure out your maintenance calories and then create a 10-20% deficit from there. I would also recommend weight training! It is so underrated as a weight-loss tool, as many believe cardio burns more calories. But for me, it is much more enjoyable and when it comes to calories burned over time, it is way more than cardio. Plus, by gaining more muscle mass you are increasing the number of calories you burn at rest! If you need help with any of this, I'd be more than happy to help you out! I'm not a coach, but I have my Bachelor's in Exercise Science so I just really enjoy this stuff. I also have a few good Facebook group recommendations if you're interested in finding a community.

				"I started doing the keto diet and limiting my carbs to under 50g a day. I by no means do this perfectly lol, I\u2019ve actually only been doing it for a week so far. I walk frequently and do some ab workouts also.

It is super hard, but I\u2019m down 3.8 pounds in a week, my wedding is in August \ud83d\ude0a",
				"View Quoted Comment It is definitely possible to drop 10, that's about 1 pound a week which is considered a comfortable rate of weight loss. 15 would be difficult and stressful. If you've already adjusted your movement and nutrition start looking at lifestyle and habits. So things like deep breathing before meals to lower cortisol levels to make you less likely to store fat. Practice eating slowly which will also lower cortisol levels but also help you digest more efficiently. Adopt a bedtime routine to help you recover better from your workouts. And start adding self-care like massages, bubble baths, meditation, etc. I know all of this probably sound frivolous and unrelated but the goal with all of this is to get your body functioning more optimally so that everything your doing with your nutrition and exercise becomes more effective. **side note I'm a fitness, wellness and nutrition coach and these are the things that make a big different when my clients want to speed things up. That and just tweaking your workout program",
				"View Quoted Comment Sorry I didn't mean to reply to your comment earlier. I was trying to just comment on the thread and accidentally tapped your comment",
				"View Quoted Comment Haha no worries! I enjoyed reading your suggestions anyway, and plan on trying some of them",
				"The general rule of thumb is about 1 pound per week is sustainable weight loss, so if you have 70 days left that means you can sustainably lose about 7 pounds. Losing more than that is absolutely possible, but it usually results in more drastic adjustments to your calorie intake and exercise levels, which typically are not sustainable long term.Having said that, it all depends on where you start and what your goal is. If you have super unhealthy habits and are drastically overweight, improvements to diet and exercise might result in more like 2-3 pounds of weight loss per week at the beginning, and slower taper off as you reach a more ideal weight. If you have already been working on diet and exercise, 1-2 pounds a week is more likely, but as you get closer to a healthy weight those numbers tend to budge less even if you keep healthy habits.Keep in mind stress is generally counterproductive to weight loss. So if you become too focused on the number on the scale, you may be doing more harm than good. Focus on healthy habits that sustain your body AND mind, like drinking plenty of water, avoiding excess sugar, eating plenty of fresh foods especially vegetables, getting adequate sleep, and moving your body throughout the day (as opposed to just doing a workout and then remaining sedentary for the rest of the day). If you find yourself getting stressed, remind yourself that 10-15 pounds makes absolutely zero difference in your self-worth.",
				"One quick note (since there are so many great suggestions above)--take note of the difference between losing pounds and losing inches! I did a 6 week fitness/nutrition challenge and lost 6.8% body fat, but only lost 5 pounds. HOWEVER, my clothes fit better and I can tell certain parts of my body are more defined--muscle takes up less \"space\" than fat. So you may not be losing the number of pounds that you want, but you might be losing inches!"

It really can be challenging to healthily follow but I highly recommend it! Just beware it truly is a lifestyle change and just like any diet if you plan on going right back afterwards you will gain the weight back! But in my experience you should have no problem losing 24-30 lbs doing keto and working out.",
				"Most of your weight loss is dependent on what you put on your fork. You'll want a deficit between calories in versus calories out. I use MyFitnessPal to monitor the calories that I am consuming (and yes, I do weigh/measure out all of my food). Additionally, I use a Fitbit to track my calorie burn throughout the day. I had a personal trainer for a couple years, so I follow the workout and meal plans he created for me and try for a calorie deficit of 900-1000 calories a day (1400 calories consumed with a burn goal of 2300). However, while those numbers work for me, they may not work for you. If you can, I'd recommend going to see a nutritionist or personal trainer who can help you create a plan that works best for you. If you want to see lasting results, you'll have to find a plan that changes your eating habits and activity levels permanently rather than a \"diet\" that you'll go off of once the wedding is over. And if you don't happen to lose the weight, remember that your FS loves you just the way you are and you will be absolutely unmatched on your wedding day.",

I highly suggest finding a professional who can help make a plan and monitor to make the most healthy changes for your body.",

It runs in my family anyway, but the diet of keto (high fat, low carb) can lend itself to increasing cholesterol. Heart health is so important to me now, and I'm still trying to course correct from that. Everyone is different, but please check with a doctor for heart health before doing something that drastically changes what you're eating.On my end, I lost 30lbs in a year for my wedding. However, I did cheat a good amount (lots of pre-wedding events where I couldn't not eat what the hosts prepared for me) on the weekends. I practiced Intermittent Fasting and cut back carbs and sugar as much as I could. I still ate small portions of whole grains (for the heart to get healthier!), but ultimately just watching portion size. I also have done Weight Watchers in the past and highly recommend it. It is one of the best programs to educate on overall healthy eating, how to sustain it, how to allow for \"cheats\" and \"treats\", etc. It's definitely not the fastest program, but if this is something you've been feeling for a long time and want to continue past your wedding, WW is amazing.I have no doubts you'll look beautiful on your day. I love late April weddings! Best of luck",
				"Make sure to loose weight healthy my ssuggestion is to cut out sofa, eat lean meats no fast food plenty of veggies and fruit",
				"Definitely cut out Soda. I've been on Strict Keto since August. Between Sept and Nov I've lost 11lbs. Now in February back on Strict Keto I've lost about 25lbs. I've lost about 25-31lbs so far. But I've gone down alot in inches. So much I've gone down about 2 sizes. Keto is a change of lifestyle and its NOT for everybody. If it's not for your, eli mate soda and junk food. Also incorporate walking more and you can always do classes at home us and ng youtube.",

I already feel defeated just by the scale but I\u2019m about to go to my garage and hit a work out while the kids are in school. Just looking for some encouragement.

				"Hi Celina! I get how you feel. When I first met my FH, I was 105 and 2 weeks ago when I weighed myself, I was 172 which is the heaviest I've been.Since then, I've lost a few pounds, and I'm at 166.4 this morning! I just drastically cut my calories because I realized I was taking in a lot more than what I was burning off from everyday activities and working out, so I'm doing a calorie deficit right now. NOTE: Everyone's calorie deficit is different so the amount of calories I'm taking in now, won't necessarily be the amount you need to take in! I'm only taking in 1200 calories a day, and on days I work out heavily, I bump it up to around 1350 depending on how I'm feeling that day! I've cut my portion sizes drastically, and cut down on foods that I ate too much of like heavy starches/carbs (cakes, breads, pastries, rice, etc.). I still eat carbs, but I'm more mindful of my intake! I also don't snack as often, and when I do, I go for more healthy options like fruits, or low calorie snack packs that I get at Aldi!I work out 4 times a week, and on days I don't work out, I take my dog on a 30min walk. That way I'm not overexerting myself on rest days, but I'm still getting some soft of exercise in. Another thing is STAY CONSISTENT. Before, I would do good for like a week, then the weekend would hit and I would eat terrible foods and go back to bad habits. Staying consistent with my calorie intake, and working out has helped me lose pounds quick!",
				"View Quoted Comment Congratulations! That\u2019s awesome. I know what I need to do it\u2019s just the motivation to stay consistent is hard.

				"View Quoted Comment Thank you!! It's tough to find the motivation. I'm bad at procrastinating, so I kept telling myself \"My wedding isn't until next January, I have time\", but I have to remind myself that that kind of thinking is why I'm at the weight I am today. Wanting to look good is good motivation, but also, think about your sweet kids! You def. want to be healthier and happier for them so you can keep up with them and be the best mom you can be!

				"Hi Celina! (Sorry for the long post!)I am still a year away from my wedding day, but I wanted to share my experience. As a previous poster said, everyone is different, so I am not \u201cadvising.\u201d I hope perhaps you find some info helpful. (Background: I\u2019m 41, 2 children). After gaining 25 lbs in 3 yrs following grad school, I decided to get my act together and focus on my health. This was a choice I made for ME, not my wedding (started working on it well before getting engaged). I focused on my mental/emotional health 1st (therapy, yoga, meditation...sounds new age but it worked). Even though I was making mostly healthy food choices, years of chronic stress had really messed up my hormones. I tried to reduce my calorie intake but was starving all the time (Noom, Weight watchers, and Keto did not work for me either). In November of last year, with my doctor\u2019s approval, I began taking Saffron & Ceylon Cinnamon supplements. These apparently don\u2019t work for everyone, but they worked WONDERS for me (and my mom). My appetite was back to \u201cnormal\u201d and I was able to make even healthier choices because I wasn\u2019t starving. I tracked my calories daily for several months (I kept it at 1200ish) & continued yoga, etc. & I gradually switched to a Whole Foods diet. Over the course of 3 months I lost 17 lbs. I plateaued for about 6 weeks but I didn\u2019t make any changes because I was just really happy with how I felt & how I was eating. I stopped counting calories, but stayed mindful. Then the scale started moving again and I was down another 5 lbs in 2 wks! The things I learned that were helpful for me: I approached the whole thing from a \u201cself-care\u201d mindset rather than pressuring myself to reach a goal for an event. I found activities & a way of eating that were enjoyable and sustainable (made it easy to be consistent). I do have this piece of actual advice: PUT YOURSELF 1st!!! It\u2019s so hard to do as a parent, but doing so has made me a better mom!",
				"Hi there. I think you can certainly get fit by end of August. Try not to think of as just losing lbs. Use other ways to measure like your increased energy, your defined muscles, how you feel when you look at yourself in the mirror. Want a happy goal? How about keeping up with your husband, children, and friends on the dancefloor. Your heart & lungs have to be strong to get down in a big dress. Think about all your loved ones telling you you're beautiful on your day. I want you to believe them. You got this!",
				"Also, please don't use Hydroxycut or other dietary supplements.",
				"I have lost weight since January by dieting. I do exercise, but you cant out-exercise a bad diet. For exercise, long slow distance will help you lose weight. As in 5+ miles walking or running. For diet, I mostly eat what I want, but I do not eat refined flour, refined sugar, processed vegetable oils, soda, or alcohol--no exceptions. I don't agree with the \"cheat day\" model of dieting. I eat mostly what I want, including meat, potatoes, cheese, sour cream, chocolate, fruit, peanut butter, but I have a hard line for the few things I mentioned before. This is the best way to lose weight. I also don't know if you are on any medications or regularly drink soda, but overloading your liver will make it very difficult to lose weight. Another reason to skip ALL processed foods so that your liver can process toxins and doesn't need to store them in fat.",

				"Hi Celina, I'm in the same boat as you! I'm trying to lose about 30 pounds by September when I have to start dress shopping! I would definitely recommend going to tdeecalculator.net it is a calculator that will tell you how many calories you need to eat to lose weight. This is where I started. I also do Intermittent Fasting, so I fast from 8 PM- Noon and only eat 8 hours a day, but those 8 hours I make sure I'm eating at least my calories from the TDEE calculator (not eating enough calories can actually result in slower weight loss) My last suggestion is finding a workout you enjoy! I love the HIIT videos from Emkayfit on youtube! She's got a bunch of them, all different genres of music. I don't even feel like I'm working out cause they're so fun and I pick ones where I enjoy the music! also water water water!!",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you! That\u2019s awesome",
				"First thing I need to address: do not use Hydroxycut if you have any issue getting at least 80 ounces of pure water per day. You mentioned in your post and also in a response to someone that you have a problem getting enough water. Hydroxycut specifically has been implicated in liver injuries directly related to people taking it without proper water intake as indicated on the label (ten 8-oz glasses per day). Don't mess around with this.Extreme caloric restrictions and extreme diets that arbitrarily cut out dozens of foods will not help you long-term. They are \"quick fixes\" that may work for a little while, but inevitably you will either get tired of the restrictions or your body will adjust to the caloric content and you'll plateau (or gain back.)The best way to calculate what you need to lose weight is as follows:Find your active metabolic rate. There are calculators that will do this - just Google \"calculate active metabolic rate.\" This is how many calories your body requires to sustain all of its systems properly (including your hormones and metabolism) and accounting for your activity level. A crucial part of this is not overestimating your activity level. If you have a sedentary job, even if you work out, you are probably not as active as you think you are. *This number will be approximate, so don't stress too much about which calculator to use. Any one will give you a close enough number to work with - this isn't an exact science.From there, deduct 15-30% of those calories. I generally recommend starting with 15% and increasing if you aren't seeing results fast enough. 30% is considered \"aggressive\".Using myself as an example, my AMR is 2110 calories. (I am a competitive bodybuilder, so I work out very intensely 12-14 hours per week.) If I am trying to lose weight, I will multiply that by 0.85, for a total of 1795 calories (15% deficit, rounded up for simplicity.) I can increase this to as much as 30% deficit, by multiplying 2110 by 0.70, which would be 1480 calories (again rounded up for simplicity.)Calories are what matter for weight loss. A nutrition professor once lost 27 pounds in 10 weeks eating Twinkies and Doritos because he strictly controlled his calories. I'm not saying eat Twinkies - I'm saying focus your energy on your calorie intake. People get caught up in stressing out over whether they can still eat rice and potatoes, and that isn't what matters when it comes to weight loss. Calories in < calories out.Now, you should try to consume those calories in whole foods. They are more nutritious, and you also get more bulk for the calories. 100 calories of fruit or vegetables is much more food than 100 calories of a candy bar. If you again look at \"calories in < calories out\" and evaluate your food choices that way - I can only have 1/3 of this candy bar, or I can have this full cup of strawberries for the same amount of calories - you will find yourself making the better choices naturally most of the time, because you know that 1/3 of a candy bar won't make you feel satiated, but 1 cup of strawberries probably will.And I say most of the time, because there will be times where you will pick the 1/3 candy bar. And that's okay. Again, calories in < calories out. As long as you make the good choices most of the time, and you keep those calories down even when you make the less-ideal choices, you will still lose weight. And you will be able to maintain this for longer, because you aren't depriving yourself of foods you enjoy or starving all the time.The other big tips:1. Use other measurements than the scale. Tape measures are a better judge of how you are doing. I've been 125 pounds with a 26-inch waist, and I've been 125 pounds with a 22-inch waist. The scale is only part of it.2. Don't categorize things as \"good\" and \"bad\". That's why I used the very specific language I did above about the candy bar - it isn't a bad choice, it is less ideal. When you use the word bad, you are setting yourself up to feel guilty, and that is a sneaky spiral into \"well, I shouldn't eat lunch because I made a bad choice.\"3. In the same vein, DO NOT PUNISH YOURSELF. This includes skipping meals, adding in an extra half-hour of cardio, whatever.4. Focus on your successes. Instead of \"I ate a brownie at lunch time\", say \"I ate healthfully 80% of the day.\" Instead of \"I only drank two glasses of water yesterday,\" say \"I drank one more glass of water than I did the day before.\"You will get there. Be kind to yourself, first and foremost.",

				"View Quoted Comment Yes to this!! My fiance and I have done whole 30 three different times over the last year and a half, not just for weight loss but to see what foods are causing gut inflammation and cystic acne for myself - I've found that diary and sugars (also alcohol) causes massive inflammation in my body and was also hindering my weight loss. We stick as close to Paleo as possible 80/20 of the time and work out / move 6 days a week (combo of heavy lifting, hit, running, and fasted morning walks). I've recently combined intermittent fasting (16:8) along with matcha tea (5 days a week, coffee the other two) and its worked wonders for losing weight in my stomach and toning.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yes! I started my diet to try to deal with inflammation and a chronic condition, and losing weight was a happy side effect. All your suggestions are spot on. I didn't find dairy was bad for me except for milk, but I did learn that raw vegetables just do not work for me.",
				"Hi Celina!As a mom I know how easy it is to put yourself on the back burner. I used to actually feel guilty for taking ANY amount of time away from my children to exercise. I felt SELFISH! Fast forward to me weighing 230 lbs with high BP, asthma, high cholesterol and also depression! One day I saw a pic of myself and it was a wake up call for me. I realized that taking care of me is NOT selfish. It is self love and what better example to show our kids than to show them that mom is important too? Mom's health is also important and it also shows them that being physically active, in this lazy and technological age is OK to do! I not only lost all the weight and am back down to a solid 130 lbs at 5'5\", I found a love and passion for fitness. So much so that I certified to become a personal trainer and train all my clients online virtually. It is my other love! You can do this. it does take time and hard work. Just remember that if you slip up, it is NOT a failure, it is just a bump in the road on the way to your success. The best advice I can give to not look for a quick fix because they are not sustainable and often result in gaining back the weight. Find a healthier, calorie deficit meal plan that works with your likes. If you like chocolate, don't cut it out, go for a smaller portion or sugar free version. Also, definitely use an app to track your meals. You would be surprised how much you actually eat calorie wise when you start tracking it. Plus it keeps you accountable. My favorite is MyFitnessPal but there are tons out there you can use.best of luck! You got this!",
				"Hello! I understand where you are. I am also very short 5\u20190, with a lot of thighs and a big butt, at my smallest I was too 110 but kept my weight around 120 until I was 23 and I gained a lot of weight. My highest was 167 and the weight on such a small frame was hurting my joints everything would crack and ache. Last March I was 167 right now I am 146. Last July I promised myself I would lose 20 pounds before going dress shopping in September. I refused to feel anything but beautiful when trying on dresses, especially since my last dressing room experience ended in my crying at my reflection. I made a vow to get 10,000 steps everyday for 30 days and I was in a caloric deficit. I crunched the numbers on a website that helps you find out exactly how much you should be eating going off of your age, weight, gender height and activity level. I did an hour of walking (in place) a day and after about 40 minutes after each meal I would do 20 minutes of walking to jumpstart the calorie burning and to keep me moving throughout the day. I also did intermittent fasting which honestly worked wonders for me. I stopped eating red meat, switched to turkey bacon, turkey burgers, ground turkey etc. basically found better alternatives for the foods I like to eat instead of cutting everything out. From July 12 to September 4 I lost 15 pounds. Since then I hit a plateau but I am maintaining the weight loss and relying on a deficit which makes the weight loss process slower but I can still see it. I\u2019m one pound away from being 20 pounds down all together. The goal is another 15 by June. But you can do it. And it doesn\u2019t have to be a crazy workout plan. It can be something as simple as walking and I was only walking in place to a really upbeat playlist I made. My fianc\u00e9 jogs in place to family feud and is also slimming down. We\u2019ve also gone sugar free, so sugar free syrup, drinks, sweets etc. and we have found alternatives that still taste great to us so it doesn\u2019t feel like we are taking away foods we enjoy, just finding a better alternative. I think it\u2019s the only way it can be sustainable. Start with a step count goal, get a step tracking watch. You can start with 5,000 a day and increase it slowly. Getting to 10,000 in quarantine wasn\u2019t easy, I think for the first couple of days I could only get 7000. I would walk in place while brushing my teeth or waiting for the microwave to finish. Even while doing the dishes, though that was a bit messy.",

There's also a moderator that will follow up with you if you don't check in - so I definitely feel like I've got to check-in each day.

But with the big day coming in August, I was determined! My friend has been going to a infrared sauna spa, and has been dropping a TON of weight and she has said it has made her skin much clearer. The spa isn't in a location convenient to me, so I went to Amazon. They have a home version that is around $120, I purchased. It claims in the manual you burn 2000 calories per session-I am not buying that its that much- but it does make me SWEAT. Like more than I have ever sweat in my life! I can also feel my heart rate spike up while using it. I have had it for about a week and have used it 3 times, and have lost 4 pounds from a weight I have been stuck at for over a month. It's not a magic fix, but it has really helped me stay motivated and break plateaus.",

I've turned that around and am having an apple for breakfast with a cup of tea (skimmed milk), then a noodle snack or couscous for lunch with fizzy water. I haven't changed my evening meals too much, although I'm trying to keep the portion size down a bit. For the changes I've made I don't think I've lost as much as I might have expected, but I have lost some, and since I've not cut everything out totally as I'm still having nice things in the evening (for example I'm still eating up Turkish Delight from Christmas a little bit at a time) I'm hoping it will be more sustainable than an all-out diet which strips the joy out of life.",

				"I second what Robin said about Ketosis. I have been going to a local Weight Loss Clinic for about 6 months now and have lost 56lbs. I learned what I needed to know in the first 2 months but continue to go for the accountability. My daily routine is to keep my calories under 1000, Fats between 40-50, and Carbs under 25.

My typical day consisits of 5-6 meals, lots of protein from chicken, ground turkey and egg whites, tons of veggies, healthy starches like Ezekial bread, sweet potatoes and brown rice. I cut out all processed foods and do tons of meal prep for FH and I on the weekends son we don't have any excuses to eat poorly during the week.",

To lose a pound a week you have to eat 500 calories less than your maintaining intake. Tips to do this well: get a food scale, and write out what each thing is worth. You could use my fitness pal, but I just wrote my stuff on sticky notes. Some days I wanted more to eat or I wanted something that was out of budget, so I got on the treadmill and walked until I worked it off. After a few weeks you won\u2019t have to count as hard bc you\u2019ll be able to kinda know what the right amount of food is for you."

			"content": "Here's my struggle...I have a skin condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. \"Hidradenitis suppurativa (hi-drad-uh-NIE-tis sup-yoo-ruh-TIE-vuh) is a skin condition that causes small, painful lumps to form under the skin. The lumps can break open, or tunnels can form under the skin. The condition mostly affects areas where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts.\"It runs in my family. You can't always see it, but it's painful to deal with and the surgical scars I have from removing some of the sites (they tend to come back) are a little embarrassing. I've had two mass removals under each arm and two removals in the chest wall. The most obvious scars that remain are on my chest (between my breasts). So deep \"V\" cuts wouldn't work for me unless I risk using body make up. It's unfortunate. Any other brides out there suffer from this condition? Does the condition or scars impact your choice in wedding dress styles? Interested to hear from others.",
			"comments": [
				"I\u2019m sorry to hear that you suffer from this. Your FH obviously loves you for who you are so wear whatever makes you happy and don\u2019t worry about anyone else. I\u2019m sure you will be a beautiful bride no matter what.",
				"View Quoted Comment Thanks Cyndy! I appreciate your kind words. Fortunately for me, the lumps are rarely visible (only when close to the surface) and he doesn't seem to mind the surgical scars. They aren't hideous but definitely noticeable. When I wear a corset of any sort, you can't see them at all, so that's a good thing!",
				"Have you looked into the body foundation Kim Kardashian came out with? I haven't personally used it, but I have a friend with some scarring that really liked it. I would just try on a large array of dresses and pick the one you feel most beautiful in regardless if scars are showing or not.",
				"I have seen this condition before, does boosting your immune system decrease the incidence of it happening?",
				"View Quoted Comment Interesting! I may look into this, thanks! I have minimal scaring, but it bothers me to not have al the options I want and feel completely confident in it. Regardless, I know there's a perfect gown out there for me and it won't be an issue.",
				"View Quoted Comment Actually the opposite. From what I understand, it's like an autoimmune response gone overboard. Lowering my immune response would reduce flair ups. Meds like Humira are recommended for the more severe cases, but my case isn't severe enough to warrant Humira. It is, however, severe enough to warrant surgical intervention (basically, just removing masses as they occur). My surgeon once told me as long as I have skin, I will continue to have flair ups. It is what it is. I have learned that as my weight increased, so did my frequency of flair ups. When I was most fit, I rarely had any!",
				"View Quoted Comment Do certain foods affect it, have you noticed?",
				"View Quoted Comment That\u2019s a good question. I haven\u2019t noticed. I do know certain deodorants do...and friction.",
				"I'm so sorry you have this condition. I don't know that I have it, but I did have to switch to natural deodorant because regular brands would give me big, painful lumps under my pits. I, too, have some visible scars and discoloration I try to hide regularly. I have scarring between my breasts too, but from old, ill-fitting bras/underwire from when I was younger. There are so many beautiful dresses with plunging necklines that have a little white lace or nylon modesty panel in the middle that might cover discoloration. Some are even beaded. Something like these maybe. And you can always have one put in after alterations!:I hope that helps. And of course, there are plenty of dresses that don't have V-necks. Whatever dress you pick, pick one that you will feel confident in. You will be beautiful in it and your FH will be stunned when he sees you.",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh I love that first one. It's so pretty!! Thanks Cherry for your beautiful words of encouragement. My FH has psoriasis and understands how a skin condition can cause someone to feel guarded. What types of natural deodorants work well for you? I'm looking into trying Lum. I've read a lot of great reviews from women with HS.",
				"Tammy, I've tried a few different ones like Crystal deodorants (both the hard crystal and the liquid), and Tom's, Schmidt's and a couple others, I can't remember which. The most recent crystal deodorant I use is called Naturally Fresh and they sell it at Wal-mart. It's a roll on. It didn't do a darn thing for me over the summer, though!! I was a funky monkey! I kept my arms down and refrained from hugging people LOL! Schmidt's smells AMAZING, they have a few different scents. They didn't give me hard lumps BUT they gave me a RASH like none other so I had to stop using them - I think it was the essential oils they use.I've also heard good things about Native, but it's pretty pricey. Maybe I'll try Lume instead!! Thanks for the suggestion!",
				"View Quoted Comment I know the feeling! My surgeon advised me not to use deodorants at all, so unless I\u2019m expected to be someplace of significance (training, court appearances, etc), I go without. I always feel like I\u2019m funky even when I\u2019m not. To make matters worse, I lost my sense of smell years ago, so I can\u2019t actually tell if I\u2019m smelly *yikes*. Bless my FH, I\u2019ve asked him to bluntly let me know if I ever need to freshen up. There have only been a couple of times that he had to do so and he felt so bad for having to tell me lol. I\u2019m going to try Lume soon. I hope it works as well as the reviews claim. Thanks for sharing your reviews on the other brands!!",
				"That is one of my fears too is trying on wedding dresses or wearing a wedding dress in the future when i get married. I too suffer from HS and I know the feeling. As you said Ive worked out in the past and notice wayyy less flare ups when dieting and exercise and felt way better then before. Their is a ointment called Emuaid. I use EmuaidMAX and it works really well for HS. Less painful so try that too if you like. Hope things work out for you hun.",
				"View Quoted Comment Thanks so much of your response, Namiah. HS is tough and seems to be a never ending battle. I'll ask my doc about Emuaid and see if it might be an option for me to try based on my medical history. I'm interested in learning more about it soon!",

I was at 100 when I woke up in the morning. Last week it was down to 85. So even though my weight hasn\u2019t dropped like I wanted I\u2019m seeing the benefits. I searched Keto recipes to find ideas.",
				"Lots of water, lower carb and salt and sugar intake. Also limit alcohol consumption to help prevent bloating.",
				"I gained 25lbs because of COVID/Redundancy stress induced binge eating. My wedding has been postponed to December 2021 so I have reasonable time to lose it all, but for me that also involves learning good habits when it comes to food and exercise because obviously bingeing is not good in any circumstance whatsoever. Personally I have a deficit of 500-750cals per day based on eating moderately and doing 45mins of exercise.Losing weight/keeping fit are very personal to each and every person and no method/diet/hack works the same for 2 people. What works for some is horrible for others. Generally as a rule of thumb, a deficit of 3500 calories = 450g/1 lb of weight lost. You could very healthily lose about 6-7lbs before the wedding by applying a modest deficit, BUT I would caution you about doing so because any weight loss of more than 3-4lbs may require you to have to alter your dress at the last minute. Good luck!",
				"Beginning 6 weeks before the wedding, I worked out 6/7 days a week (pilates mostly and some jump rope) and ate healthy but had cheat days, meals, snacks sometimes (for sanity haha) until 3 weeks out.

At 3 weeks out, I went on a strict diet to focus on shedding some weight (South Beach Diet works like a charm for me) and drank only water, and dropped 10 lbs in those 2-3 weeks.

I never felt like I was starving, the intake of healthy fat really kept me full as opposed to thinking about doing something like Atkins where I would probably just cry from being hungry all day. It also really improved my digestion and boosted my energy levels. The diet definitely isn't for everybody, it's super strict and you should definitely consult with your doctor beforehand, but what I liked about it was if you follow the rules and keep it up, the science works. Boatloads of water, low carb, zero sugar, and moderate work-outs for under two months, you could probably drop 10 lbs in a totally healthy manner.",

Trying to compare yourself to other women, especially women that aren\u2019t real is never going to do anything for you. Those women are photoshopped to look like that, it isn\u2019t real life. Be happy. Be healthy. Live your life. And most importantly... BE REAL.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yup, some literally look at the edited close up pictures and asked if we could slim and straighten their fingers and make their knuckles small. Just like those Instagram models. Sorry, but this is the world we live in nowadays. A couple asked if I can edit their knees too, I can\u2019t say no \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
				"I feel the same way! I've decided to try to lose 10% of my body weight before my wedding in January and I feel bad that when I watched a friend's wedding livestream, my first thought was \"Oh dang I need to work on my arms and back before my own wedding\" instead of \"She looks great!!\"I would agree with others say about photoshop! It can be easy to manipulate and edit pictures when you have the tools and apps to do it. I'm also off social media and I think that has been helpful. At the end of the day, I would say to focus on what you can do to meet your goals and to cherish the small steps you take to get closer to them It can be hard for you to see the change overnight, but your body is definitely changing each time you make a healthier choice and is loving you for it!",
				"Try to think positively, everyone is different and that\u2019s what make us unique and special. I am skinny, but super short. I get upset sometimes that I need to take off like 9\u201d of my wedding dress so that it would fit. I think most importantly is how you feel. Don\u2019t focus on looking like the models, but focus on how you will look amazing and your fianc\u00e9 will love you regardless.",
				"My mom wanted me to lose weight and I told her that my fianc\u00e9 loves my little curves and me just the way I am\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70 we shouldn\u2019t have to feel obligated to change our bodies to conform to Pinterest (unrealistic) brides. There\u2019s amazing shareware out there that can hug you on all the right places \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Just remember, the internet lies lol. These photos have probably been photoshopped. Not to mention they\u2019re girls are likely paid models. I am sure you will look just as gorgeous as any of these girls.",
				"I am feeling this same way! I had my minimony and I LOVED the way I felt and looked during that and now that I'm trying to find my dress for the big wedding next year, I'm having such body insecurity. I did hardcore bootcamps 5 nights a week leading up to minimony and calorie counted as well, only cheating a few times. I did a shot of ACV in the am and of course, it was warmer out, so I was even more active. But I'm sort of letting myself live right now and still staying active but only bootcamp twice a week and then a run...and i'm hating how I look in every dress I am so quick to give the body positivity talk to my friends but can't take my own advice. I admitted this to myself today and am going to make this my goal, but also try to stay off of social media because I find myself comparing myself to models but also some of my friends.",
				"Giiiirl SAME BOAT. I danced growing up and was very active, so I've accepted the fact that I won't have a tiny waste, hips, or thighs. Remember that photoshop is used heavily in those photos and to not compare yourself! Your future partner fell in love with you and you as a whole, not those pictures online!",
				"You are beautiful just the way you are. Don't let society's opinions of beauty get you down.",
				"I bought my dress 2 years ago when I was 29. I don't know what happened in those 2 years (yay for 30's), because my wedding dress that looked like it was made for me and looked perfect now shows my lumpy bits haha! So after crying about it for a bit, I went to a lingerie shop and got the right shapewear. And then recommitted to my exercise routine and clean eating. The main thing is my FH thinks I am the sexiest and prettiest woman around and I am confident in that even if my stomach isn't flat and I have some cellulite on my hips to go with my stretch marks. Just gotta embrace it all.",
				"Social media such as Instagram is a target for that particular demographic of the super thin, heavily filtered, heavily photoshopped models (many of them really are that thin due to drugs and other lifestyle choices but are filtered to not have any freckles or other natural beauty marks) who don't represent real life at all. They know it preys on insecurities which is why they do it. There's plenty of healthy normal sized brides online, including plus sizes. But you won't find them on Instagram or similar sites. Do a search on Google for plus size brides and most are a standard 8-12. In the modelling world, anything larger than a street size 6 (or a bridal size 4) is considered plus size, which perpetuates body image insecurities. Don't let them pressure to lose weight or change your appearance unless you planned to anyway without their influence.",
				"I know exactly how you feel. I've been pretty thin my entire life until after I got out of the military. Turns out I have hypothyroidism. I ended up gaining weight ridiculously and makes it that much harder for me to lose weight but I still want to lose as much as I can for my wedding.It's definitely a struggle dealing with depression and anxiety. If you want to lose, lose for yourself and not what the media platforms shove down your face to make you feel like you're not the amazing person you are because you don't wear a size 00.",
				"I totally feel you girl! I've been trying to work on my arms but yeah I totally feel you. There can be a lot of pressure to look your best and be in your best shape.",
				"99% of people don't look like this, so don't get yourself down about. You look beautiful from what I can see in your avi.",
				"The average American woman is 5'4\" and 170 pounds, and roughly a dress size 12-14. By comparison, the average female model is 5'7\" and 114 pounds, and usually closer to a 0-2 (taller models will sometimes be a size 4-6). So unless you happen to be very slender and tall with amazing bone structure and flawless skin, the women in these staged, stylized shoots, typically paid models or \"influencers\" or other not-average people, aren't going to be representative of our realities.Pretty sells. Its what the magazines publish, its what photographers put on their websites and in their portfolios, and its what gets people to buy products in advertisements. Many of those photos are from stylized shoots, where everything, from the models, to flowers, to setting, to hair and makeup, is completely staged. I'm a photographer, I work in the athletics/recreation/fitness industry, and I'm an inch taller and 35 pounds lighter than the average American woman, and I cannot make myself look like this.One thing I found helpful was to find and follow local wedding photographers and follow their social media (not just look at their portfolios), because they often feature \"real\" couples more often than just best-of-the-best accounts by companies or agencies promoting wedding tourism or luxury photographers from the big cities who only have A-list clientele. I'd also recommend looking up the \"real brides\" sections on wedding websites. I bought my dress online from StillWhite, site unseen, pre-owned and un-returnable, and the only reason I did was because the manufacturer (Mikealla) has a \"real brides\" section of their website and I was able to see the exact dress I was buying on dozens of \"real\" women with different body types, light and dark complexions, short girls, muscular girls, etc. Don't fall in love with a dress you've only seen online on one model that doesn't look anything like you. Sites like Lulu's and BHLDN allow women to post photos with reviews and that can be a great way to see real, un-photoshopped people in wedding dresses."

Try soaking in oatmeal baths, and using rosewater(boil food safe rose petals in purified water) to cleanse, along with steam (maybe with eucalyptus oil). Dont do straight moisture as it will clog pores. Instead use moisturizing ingredients in a liquid form or a mask.

Whatever you use after, you are smearing the inffectious material and irritating pores with cleaners, or acids, that are practically an open door to bacteria to come in every opened pore. If you have no known problem with it, try Triple Antibiotic topical ( rub on) ointment. At least 3x a day, let it sit at least an hour. if you are putting on nice clothes, ointment leaves greasy spots. So gently wipe it off then water wash. When there is no redness or irritation for 3 days, then you are ready to start something new.",

			"content": "I think I have some sort of an eating disorder. I\u2019ve struggled with weight my whole life and constantly yo-yo dieted. I\u2019ve also been quite healthy at some times, but recently between being made redundant a few months ago / COVID / and now renovating, my anxiety has come back and I\u2019ve been binge eating really really badly. I\u2019ve gained about 25lbs which I\u2019m now hoping to lose before my December 2021 wedding. To top it off, FH and I will need to live with my parents for about 8 weeks next year when we renovate our apartment. My parents have shocking eating habits just the same so it won\u2019t be a great environment but we can\u2019t really avoid it (our floors are water damaged so we need to renovate at risk of mold, and we can\u2019t afford to rent a place temporarily, at least not somewhere comfortable and pet friendly). For this reason I\u2019m quite anxious about moving in with them given how bad my eating habits are already. Has anyone else overcome binge eating? I\u2019m hoping to get out and exercise regularly and try eat a balanced diet but I realize that my habits need to be curbed for once and for all. Would love any input from anyone who has gone through this themselves.",
			"comments": [
				"I began struggling with eating disorders at 16 years old. I was a tall girl, which naturally kind of took away the dainty factor that a lot of girls have. I wouldn\u2019t eat for a few days then binge. I managed to stay rather thin until college, where I gained about 20 lbs but still wasn\u2019t anywhere near \u201cfat\u201d despite what I would tell myself. I ended up losing a significant portion of my hearing between 21 yrs old and 25. They tried to combat this hearing loss with steroids which lead to a 60lb weight gain and a complete destruction of my self confidence. I\u2019m now 26 yrs old, my wedding is planned for 11/13/21 and often thoughts of being \u201cthin\u201d again haunt me. I often think to myself that when I was younger I could go days with out eating and if I could just do that again... but now that I\u2019m older I know it\u2019s not sustainable and not healthy and that I need to lose weight a different way...My advice, find someone who you can talk openly too about this. I struggle myself because my friends do not understand what it\u2019s like to have an eating disorder. They don\u2019t realize that constant talk about eating or dieting is rather triggering for me. I believe Talking it out when you have that urge to binge can be really helpful. Just a gentle reminder that eating in excess isn\u2019t going to satisfy what you need. If you ever need support or encouragement feel free to message me on here. It\u2019s a hard situation but I understand how it is in many ways",

I have a friend who has thankfully recovered from an eating disorder and I feel like she may be my voice of reason to whom I can vent given she\u2019s been through this all herself (providing it isn\u2019t triggering for her).Perhaps if you ever need someone non biased, you have a new person to whom you can vent to, on the other side of the world?!",
				"If thinking about your weight and eating or not eating is taking up enough of your thoughts that it's becoming difficult to focus on or enjoy other things, you should see a therapist. If it hasn't quite gotten to that level, you should probably talk to a nutritionist. They'll be able to help you get to weight you want to be (assuming it's a healthy weight for you) in a healthy way and kind of help you moderate and manage your food intake. I would definitely recommend starting this before moving in with your parents so you're starting off in a better place than you're in now. I've never been treated for an eating disorder, but I definitely have, at best, disordered (restrictive) eating habits. My parents don't have shocking eating habits, but the voice in my mom's head telling her not to eat things is mine, so living with them would be problematic for me as well. I've been able to keep the stress at a manageable level and my weight is stable, I know I wouldn't be able to maintain that if I were living with my parents.",
				"Have you ever heard of intuitive eating? I would start there and reach out to a therapist with experience in eating disorders.",

I frustrate myself with it but it really feels like an addiction. I really want to set (and keep) goals but with anxiety and depression (hitting me like never before) I continue to turn to food- carbs, cheese, and lately sugar. \ud83d\ude1eIf you're looking for an online friend to hit up with vents, accountability partner, or just chat about stuff you can message me? \ud83d\ude0a I'm sure we can chat via some messenger app \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

Exercise helped shift my thinking about eating so that I was eating in ways that would take care of my body and help me improve my performance rather than look a certain way and also exercise can help you with stress relief so that you aren\u2019t eating emotionally. Another thing that helped a lot was trying to eat more good things instead of trying not to eat bad things. So I would just make an effort to add more vegetables to my diet instead of restricting. I also stopped counting calories and stopped weighing myself. Even when I went to the doctor for a check up, I asked them not to tell me my weight because it was triggering for me. Also for your situation, moving in with your parents, you don\u2019t have to eat what they eat, you can set up a section of food for yourself that is nourishing or if you do want to eat with them find healthy recipes that you can cook and enjoy together, or eat what their eating during dinner time but practice stopping when you\u2019re full and eating healthier for the rest of the days meals."

I planned my wedding in 10 weeks mostly by myself so there was a lot is stressful moments. I found that taking a step back maybe for a few hours or few days helped. I would also call friends or family that I knew I could talk to and always found time for a day to myself. Trips to the spa or long hikes or beach days helped me.

				"Planning a December wedding and we are now just under 100 days until I Do! Honestly, months ago I was anxious, stressed, and thought there is no way we can make this happen. But I just had to LET IT GOOO! We had to drop all our previous expectations and become really flexible. First though, me and my partner sat down and said what are our limits were to canceling/staying, what are must haves and don't wants, and made a lot of plan A,B,C's. We basically decided what is the most important and the rest doesn't matter. We reduced our guest list in half and began planning everything with a pandemic lense full of flexibility and open-mindedness. Even now, we know our plans can change in an instant and we are at peace with it. After I let go all my previous expectations it releived a lot of pressure. I still feel frantic at times, but I breathe, talk it out, and re-adjust! You will get through this, no matter what y'all choose to do! It may not be exactly what you envisioned, but it can still be great!",
				"I remember when it came close to the wedding I definitely took a day and just relaxed with my husband. We went out and got a couple massages. We just needed a day where it wasn\u2019t about wedding planning and logistics anymore because it can get overwhelming",

We started doing it when the pandemic shutdowns started, but we never completely stopped - I bought an umbrella in our wedding colors the day before. It didn't rain, but having it all of those plans made it feel like we'd be able to handle anything that came up. Also, I don't know how much you're worried about the whole covid situation, but making a comprehensive plan to keep people safe made me feel better. Looking at what I just typed, I realize that obsessively planning things is probably not relaxing for everyone. I knew from the beginning that I wasn't really concerned about doing things the traditional way and I wasn't, and still am not, really interested in what (most) other people had to say about our plans, but it can still be difficult to know how to respond when people you care about think their opinion is important. Reminding myself over and over that it's our day/s, we're inviting them to celebrate (eventually) with us, but it's not about them was not relaxing. But, after doing that enough times, I was able to let things go without feeling bad or really even thinking too much about it, and that really reduced my stress level. I also find yoga really relaxing.",

				"I used to take 3 straight months of BC before having a period, just skip the placebo week and go into the active pills of the next pack. This was gyno approved (and even suggested because I had anemia). It might depend on the specific mix of horomones in your pills - give you gyno a call to double check.",
				"I also have irregular hormones and can't take hormone based birth control. I don't work out for a few months. I also massively track my period and look for any possible trends so I can kind of predict it now (been doing this for 3 years) if my period is expected around a special event I start a new hardcore core workout the week before and I workout throughout the period because it makes me bleed faster and makes my period shorter. I also use a few super+ tampons (I usually never use tampons) and it seems to help make the period bleed less than it normally does after use. I also drink more caffeine and eat more chocolate right before the new workout. It is the only way I have managed to get my period to be kind of predictable. If you have time try tracking and try a few different things to see if you can induce your period or even semi predict when it will be. Keep in mind stress plays a huge part on when your period visits as well.",

				"0.5 to 2lbs a weeks is considered healthy. For what to do, I think you really have to look at where your lifestyle could use improving. For example, my fiance struggle with portion sizes so his key to losing weight is counting calories and measuring food. My struggles are weekends: overindulging and alcohol calories. Some programs that are good are: WW and South Beach (book not meal service). It really depends on what kind of program will work for you. WW is very structures and if you not have much dieting experience will really give you the support you need. South Beach is a lower carb diet, but after the first 2 weeks complete carbs are added back in slowly. If you don't like counting points or calories, I would recommend this one. If you don't want to buy the book, you can google the PDF and it can get you started. Losing weight is mostly about your diet, not exercises. So for exercise find something you enjoy and can keep up with. Fun dance video, kickboxing, walking with a friend, etc. It is more important that you move then exactly what or how you move. Best of luck: my fiance lost about 60lbs for our wedding and I lost 20lbs. I kinda made up my own plan from years of different diets and it has been the most successful yet! We counted calories, worked out, and ate nearly all of our meals at home.",

I recently started using the Sweat App at home, and I'm a big fan of her workouts too. She has a lot you can do it at home and also at the gym.",
				"Weight loss is a numbers game. As Alex said above, 2 pounds is kind of the max to lose per week if you're doing it in a healthy way. Your body uses up a certain number of calories a day just by existing (there are calculators online which can help you determine your number). The idea is you want to burn more calories than you take in. This is usually done by a combination of calorie deficit and exercise. One pound of fat is equal to about 3500 calories, so you need to burn an additional 3500 calories in a week to lose 1 pound of fat per week. There are tons of free apps like MyFitnessPal which help you track your calories and your exercise. The best thing to do is to educate yourself on portion sizes and healthy eating, as well as exercise. Any exercise will help you burn calories as long as it gets your heart rate up. You will be more likely to do the exercise if it's something you like to do (doesn't matter how many calories running will burn if you can never get yourself to go running). Also, muscle weighs more than fat but the more muscle you have, the more calories you actually burn at rest throughout the day, so something else to be mindful of.",
				"View Quoted Comment This. You lose weight in the kitchen and get fit in the gym. Your weight loss will also depend on \u201chow much\u201d your body can afford to lose. I.E. a person who is larger will be able to lose more weight than a smaller person simply because they have more mass to lose. When I was on my weight loss journey a few years ago, losing 15 pounds in 8 months was awesome for me, but that wouldn\u2019t be much weight loss for someone who had more mass. OP, I would absolutely start tracking your current diet (on an app like MyFitnessPal) and see where you can start making healthy changes. Start with one or two smaller things and then increase it as you hit those goals. Please don\u2019t try any \u201ccrash\u201d or \u201cfad\u201d diets; they\u2019re typically not very good for your body and will not result in long-term results.

				"As others said, put out less calories than you are taking in. I\u2019d recommend counting calories with MyFitnessPal (it\u2019s shocking to know what we\u2019re really eating) and focus on setting your workout regime accordingly. They allow you in the app to set a target goal weight and it lets you know how many calories you must eat to meet that goal.",

				"Personal Trainer, here. You need to start by calculating your maintenance calories so you know how much you need to be eating to lose weight. As the other ladies suggested, download my fitness pal so you can track your calories and macros. I would also suggest getting a food scale and weighing everything so you can get precise numbers. The best thing you can do is eat lots of protein, focusing on lean meats-turkey, chicken, fish, etc. Lots of vegetables, and limit the amount of processed foods you consume. Diet will be the main way you're going to lose weight, but strength training and cardio are going to give you the shape you want.",

I think you are beautiful in that dress and I think we as women need to stop being so hard on ourselves. That we need to let ourselves be real women. Think about all the awesome things that your body has done and continues to do for you. I would also say that finding some nice shapewear or slip can change the entire look of your dress. An underskirt/petticoat to give your hips some more flare will make the waist look smaller in comparison.",

Way easier than braces as long as your good about keeping them in when you aren't eating. Check you're insurance, a lot of insurances will cover half the cost. My dentist offers Invisalign pretty cheap so I went that route, but i did like the information I found on Smile Direct, it's probably the exact same service. There are probably instances where it won't work, my dentist actually had to make minor shavings between my teeth for them all to fit together, for example. But if your issue is minor it sounds like Smile Direct would work for you. My teeth were pretty crooked btw, and they're already looking so straight!",
				"My sister is a dentist and completely advised against smile direct cause you don\u2019t have a dentist monitoring your progress. That being said, I went and used SD instead of Invisalign because my insurance didn\u2019t cover any of it. I read online that you have to be very diligent in keeping them on because you\u2019re not getting monitored. I am extremely happy with the results, it\u2019s been 5 months and my teeth are back to the way they were. I only have a week left of having to wear them!!! I\u2019ve never worn braces and my teeth were perfect until I got into my industry, so needing to get my teeth straight was a must!",
				"I used SDC and was extremely happy with my results. You'll find mixed reviews online, just like any other service. My best advice is to continue seeing your regular dentist twice yearly and be honest with them about using SDC. That way they will notice any irregularities.",
				"Does SDC correct bite problems?",
				"I just finished Invisalign and loved it. My friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 used smile direct and had a great experience as well. With SDC you never have face to face contact with your orthodontist (all is online) their storefronts are more along the line of retail locations than medical offices. For me, it was worth it to pay more for in-person visits with a licensed orthodontist.",
				"I have Invisalign. I\u2019ve read so many horror stories about smile direct club bc they don\u2019t move the jaw with the liners and you don\u2019t have orthodontist supervision over time. Just what I\u2019ve read. But I\u2019ve had a great experience with Invisalign. I mean perfect teeth, no treatment and no payments would have been my first choice but Invisalign has been good.",
				"I used SmileDirect - had a 7 month plan and finished in January of this year. I am very happy overall. My teeth are not perfect and did not end up like my plan showed, but they are much better than they were and I spent way less money. My only advice is to be aware that with SDC you may not be done by the time of your wedding - they can be horrible at shipping their products (very delayed, send wrong aligners etc) and it is possible you may need a mid course or end course correction. You also have to wear your retainers full time for a bit after you are finished (depends on the person).",
				"My fianc\u00e9 is doing Invisalign and it\u2019s working real well for him. He\u2019s only had it for about 4 weeks now but I def see an improvement!",
				"Update!!! I went with Smile Direct Club and so far so good!! My HSA (health savings account) through work covered the cost of almost my entire treatment and my treatment will be complete one month prior to the big day!! Here is my day 1 photo!! My teeth hurt but it\u2019s normal for the first few days. I\u2019m also getting skin treatments so don\u2019t mind my face and it\u2019s texture right now. \ud83d\ude43",
				"I tried smiledirect and that was painful, its hard to stick to it and also some trays don't fit even after wearing them for the time it needs to be worn for. I have gone and gotten the regular old braces and am rocking a new color every month."

How did you make yourself feel beautiful for your wedding even with extra weight that you personally were not comfortable with?",
			"comments": [
				"So I've gained quite a bit of weight over the last few years and I keep telling myself I will lose it. I had intended on losing it for the wedding, and that never happened. Just try to remember that your fiance loves you for who you are and thinks you're beautiful no matter what size you are.",
				"I also have some weight on me and my fiance always tells me that I look good and that he loves me no matter what. I have to remember his words about him loving me just the way that I am. It makes me feel good about myself. Just remember that your fiance loves you no matter what and that you are going to be a beautiful bride.",
				"I understand that feeling. I think we all do. You have a vision of yourself and you just aren't seeing it. I suggest you change your perspective. Instead of losing weight, change the goal to getting stronger or eating healthier. Maybe a change in mindset can help you reach your goals. For a short period of time, download a calorie tracker to flush out the foods that you are eating that have low nutrition to calorie value. I discovered a few problem areas and was able to cut them out. There are also short 10 minute a day workout apps you can do at home. Also do something that usually makes you feel pretty. Put on your favorite outfit, paint your nails, try a new make-up look. It's never easy, but you got this!",
				"Congrats, you may start lessening your carb intake and less to no sugar on food would also help!",
				"First off, no matter what: you will look beautiful on your wedding!!! If you are serious about losing weight I would suggest maybe thinking of why you want to lose the weight (if you just want to lose it for one day it might be hard to stay focused on that goal instead of making a long term commitment). 5 months is a good ways away and, depending on how much you want to lose I would suggest looking into Weight Watchers! I started back in January just to lose just a little weight and get better eating habits and it really has worked/changed my life! It\u2019s a very realistic way of losing weight and it isn\u2019t so intense that you feel like your are starving yourself. It\u2019s a great long term plan! I lost about 20 lbs! Hope this helps!",
				"I keep saying I will lose weight before I get married to \"look better\" in my dress but I am struggling to do that. I have gained weight while living with my fiance so it has been on my mind for a while. I keep reminding myself that my fiance loves me and how I look. I did motivate myself to just do 5-10 minutes of workouts each day. It is a small thing but it makes me feel better about my body and I know I am doing just that little bit of effort to help.",
				"I feel you! My insurance company & doctor decided to switch medications back in December due to the cost of my previous medication. I had to go on trial with other recommended therapeutic medications to prove whether they would be just as affective as the one I have been taking consistently. Needless to say I gained 30 lbs in two months! My doctor quickly switched me back to my previous medication. Thankfully I haven\u2019t gained any more weight.I got serious about eating healthier & more regularly (not snacking) and exercising on my elliptical & doing yoga just about every day. So far I\u2019ve lost 10 lbs in a month and a half. \ud83d\udcaa"

In February I set myself up on a 2 month goal to seriously loose weight for my May 2nd dress appointment. Well here we are thanks to covid.

				"Hey girl! That\u2019s one of the positive things I\u2019m looking at with having to postpone our wedding - I get to actually work towards my body goal for my dress! Even if you don\u2019t have a home workout system, drinking lots of water, eating more good food when you\u2019re hungry, going for quick walks two times a day, and YouTube offers free at home workout videos. You\u2019ll get to where you wanna be!",
				"My advice would be to not stress yourself over losing weight or making any huge lifestyle changes during this time. Focus on your health first - mental, emotional, social, and physical - and do not add pressure to change your body while stuck at home in this weird limbo time of pandemics and uncertainty. Do things that make you feel happy and good, that promote self-care, and embrace what your body can do. As hard as it may be, try not to dwell on your size. You still have plenty of time between now and July to meet some fitness goals. Now is the time to focus on your health and feeling better, not necessarily being the skinniest or most toned version of you.There are a LOT of excellent YouTube videos for no-equipment, at-home workouts, so you can still establish a fitness routine without access to a gym and personal trainer. Setting a wellness routine for yourself will help you feel better about your body physically as well as release some good endorphins that will help reduce stress and may help curb the stress eating and wine drinking habit. Your routine should be something realistic and manageable. Start small. Do you tend to sit around and watch Netflix all day, or are you spending hours sitting in front of a computer? Make it a point to get up every hour and walk around your house or your yard for 10 minutes. Find a few fitness YouTubers you really like and set aside a half hour to do a YouTube workout twice a week, then build in a neighborhood walk a few other days a week. You basically need to take wherever you are and build on that. Fitness transformation is rarely a \"go from doing nothing and eating fried food daily to working out for an hour six days a week and subsisting off of lean proteins and fresh vegetables\" lifestyle change. It's gradual and happens over time as you build good habits starting with attainable, realistic goals and small but impactful lifestyle changes.",
				"I feel you on this. I\u2019m fairly positive my dress won\u2019t fit once I\u2019m finally able to try it on, and my wedding is supposed to be July 4th. I wanted to feel amazing on my wedding day, but so far I haven\u2019t felt amazing about anything wedding-related. My biggest hurdle is that I get into slumps. Like really really bad slumps where I feel fatigued and depressed and have no will to do anything. All the advice about doing home workouts from YouTube is the most aggravating to me in those moments because home workouts suck, I don\u2019t own any equipment, and I\u2019m not in the right headspace to work out unless I\u2019m in the proper environment (I.e the gym). I\u2019m still working on figuring out a system. I wrote down daily goals and stretch goals. Daily goals: get dressed when I first wake up, drink water throughout the day, eat meals on a schedule, and only drink alcohol and eat dessert on the weekends. Stretch goals: do something that makes me sweat at least once a day. Run at least 3 miles 3x a week (I\u2019ll bump that up to 5 miles once the weather is nicer). I\u2019ve found that when I get in those horrible funks going for a run - even if it\u2019s only a mile - is usually enough to snap me out of it and re-orient myself for the day. Walks aren\u2019t enough because they don\u2019t get my heart racing. Now my fianc\u00e9 practically forces me to run when he can tell I\u2019m depressed. We\u2019ve also taken up some garden projects to get us out of the house after the work day and help us to feel productive and accomplished. This whole situation really sucks and I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re having to endure it. It\u2019s honestly a daily fight to keep your chin up, but don\u2019t give up! I\u2019m rooting for you!",
				"View Quoted Comment I'll say I run a mile every day and it's my \"me time.\" For me running a mile and a quick shower after is about 15 minutes out of my total day, and regardless of whatever else happens, at least I know I did something good for myself every day. Running daily has helped me kind of get past/through difficult times, especially when I otherwise feel too stressed or busy to do a proper workout. It doesn't have to be a run, but carving out some time in your day to do wellness and making it a routine can be super helpful for getting through tough times. Running daily keeps my base fitness level at a certain standard too, so when I re-start a fitness routine I'm not starting from ground zero. I've run a mile every day for more than 2000 days in a row now (since Nov 2, 2014). Working out at home is kind similar to working at home in that creating a dedicated space will make you more productive and get you in the right mindset. Home workouts aren't my favorite, but they are keeping me sane(r) during this pandemic. I have a few \"go to\" workouts I'll default to if I don't have the time to come up with something more creative or test out a new program that I find on YouTube or Pinterest. I'd recommend the New York Times Scientific 7-Minute Workout (full body, limited equipment, and you can do multiple rounds for more of a challenge) or the Deck of Cards workout. I've also found some YouTube videos by MadFit and Pamela Reif that have been pretty good. You can also attempt to find a virtual workout buddy, which can make the workouts more fun and help hold you accountable. I work as an athletic director at a college so have been leading virtual fitness classes from my basement or backyard for the past month. Having students or friends on my screen just to share some smiles with with has made it a LOT more enjoyable to work out from home than when I just do a workout on my own.",
				"I feel your pain. I am also the heaviest I've ever been in my life. I think it's great to work on healthier habits in general and just trying to be more active, but I would suggest not making it a goal to loose a specific amount before trying on dresses. I feel like that is just a way to stress yourself out even further, and set the stage for beating yourself up if you don't make a specific goal. Work on small, manageable changes - no more than one or two at a time. Add more healthy habits as things stick or work for you. When things open back up, just go and start trying dresses on with the body that you have, and look for one that makes you feel beautiful right where you are. If you lose weight by the time you're ready to have the dress altered, great! If not, you still have a dress that you feel beautiful in.",
				"I feel this and I felt the same exact way when I went dress shopping. Instead of focusing on my weight and the fact that I\u2019m not where I wanted to be at all, I focused on what I wanted out of my wedding gown and what looked good on my body type so even if I don\u2019t lose the weight by the wedding day, I\u2019ll still feel good. And girl...the dresses looked FABULOUS on even though I\u2019m at my heaviest. I didn\u2019t think I could look so good, so really. Try not to stress that much about it, it\u2019s truly not worth it. Your FS is with you because they love you, not your weight.But what I\u2019ve been doing just to keep myself sane honestly is taking walks when it\u2019s nice enough to do so out and just trying to do something somewhat active at least once a day. My eating habits could use work, but I\u2019ve been trying to stick with 3 meals a day with an occasional dessert and try to keep away from mindless snacking. This time is so stressful right now though that I\u2019m doing that stuff just to make me feel better about the situation rather than lose weight. You have to do what\u2019s right for you, but my best piece of advice is to not stress too much about your weight and the dress because you\u2019ll find one that\u2019s going to make you look fabulous the way you are.",
				"I'm trying to lose weight before dress shopping too. I'm down 29 pounds thanks to Chloe Ting's free at home no equipment workouts on YouTube. She even makes scheduled programs on her website to follow. Since quarantine, I've been counting calories, staying hydrated, having my last late night snack around 9:30-10pm and I don't eat again until 1:30-2pm the next day. I wake up, workout, do chores, and then open my eating window up. I grocery shop once a week and will not buy unhealthy snacks so I won't get tempted. I'm still meal prepping my lunches as well just to have some normalcy and control. Also not drinking anything but water, green tea, and apple cider vinegar mixed with 8oz of water in the morning. I would highly recommend checking Chloe Ting out and following a program.",
				"Don't worry about that because you may think you want a straight dress now but walk in and fall in love with the total opposite. 2021 is a little ways away and it's hard to keep weight off for that long period of time, well it is for me anyway. Just make sure you do your research when deciding which shop to try out. Don't pick a place that only carries up to a size 6...save yourself the trouble. You have to remember your man proposed to you just how you are right now! Don't forget that part!",
				"I feel you have alot of time to get where you want to be . I do agree with you that you can now focus on trying the goals you want to loose the weight. I agree it is hard to eat healthy during this time when it's so stressful. Good luck",
				"I gained 30 pounds in two months due to changing medication.

I already go to the gym 5 times a week, so I'm really just increasing my cardio and doing my best to stay active over the weekends because that's when I tend to eat more. I've also been going for walks when I feel sluggish or feel like snacking - it helps me feel more energized and distracts me from snacking! I'd recommend coming up with tricks like that to distract you when you get in those sluggish moods where you just want to snack (if you're like me, that happens every evening and most weekends). Stay busy and schedule social times that don't revolve around food (I've been scheduling hikes with my friends for once the weather warms up, and snowboarding trips to hold me over until then).",

			"content": "My fiance has gained a little bit of weight and often comments on the fact that he thinks he's fat. I don't think that. but I'm not naive enough to say he hasn't gained weight (two different things). The issue at hand is that he sets goals for himself, and we'll set goals together, but then he only lasts a few days. We eat a healthy breakfast most mornings, and I meal prep lunches and dinners, so I AM doing my part to encourage healthier options. Occasionally we'll have a date night, but it seems like ever since the holidays, eating junk is more frequent than it used to be. However, I have no control over the snacks he buys some days on his way home, the junk food/catering he is subject to at his job. With the wedding in 2 months, he's putting a lot of pressure on himself to somehow lose 10-20 pounds, but isn't really doing much to make that happen. It's gotten to the point where he may not fit into the suit pants/jacket we bought for him (only a $100 setback, but since we're paying for the wedding ourselves, it's kind of a big deal to have to buy a completely new suit). Has anyone else gone through this? I really don't see him as \"fat\" the way he sees himself, and I'm not at all disgusted by him like I've seen on some forums, but I don't really know what else to do to help encourage him to keep up his goals.

He used to work at our gym, so I know he has the tools (and the membership) to go. We don't do it every single day, but his thought process is that because his new job is pretty physically taxing (on his feet and moving around pretty much all day), he doesn't need to work out as hard because he's burning a lot of calories. Keep in mind this is the same job that brings in catering and fast food all the time...I've hit my goal weight and am working on maintaining right now so I can fit in my dress, but he's fluctuating between gaining and losing what seems like the same few pounds, and it's upsetting him.",
				"I sympathize with you on this. When I graduated university and got an office job I went from being really active to not going to the gym for a few months because I had less control over my schedule and it was more difficult to fit it into the day. We also had people bringing baking and other food into the office daily, which didn't help. I ended up putting on about 15 pounds because of this. My FH was good about it because he never told me that he thought I was fat, but gently encouraged me to find the time to get my butt back to the gym because he knew I was unhappy about the weight gain. Thankfully once I started working out regularly I just stopped wanting to eat all of the food at work and was good about bringing my own healthier food with me.You're doing everything you can to help your FH, it really just comes down to him wanting to put in the effort enough. One other thing that did help me was FH offering to go to the gym with me or design a workout plan for me (he used to be a personal trainer).",

I was taking a yoga class and student teaching a separate class, so I went from being extremely active to sedentary in the course of a week.

We've tried creating workout plans together, and it last for a few days before he decides that it's not giving him what he needs (although I'm not exactly sure what it is he needs). I recently got him a portable pull-up bar for his birthday (his idea!) and he's started doing a few reps every time he walks through the doorway. I'm just concerned that he's not going to see the results he wants to over the next 2 months and he's going to give up entirely.",

During the holidays I would have a few because I realized denying myself completely would just make me eat more of them/ want them even more. But now I'm back on track but it's hard when they are available so I try to keep pretzels or I really like the little cutie oranges since they are sweet so they almost replace sweets for me instead.",

We don't live together, so I don't completely regulate his meals, but I cook dinner (and sometimes lunch) for him as often as I an to encourage healthier living, but we can't control them when we're not around. I had to have a talk with my FH after he was complaining yet again that he was gaining weight. I told him that I still found him attractive and I didn't think he was fat at all, BUT if he was so concerned and wanted to lose weight, I would be more than happy to (due to health stuff, I'm on a highly restrictive diet and I've learned a lot about what affects weight in the past 3 years). I've finally got him to stop eating so much processed nonsense when I'm not around and he's already feeling better.Does your FH eat the lunch that his work provides, or your meal prepped lunch? If he is serious about wanting to lose weight, as I'm sure you know, he will have to try to hold off on partaking of the office food (the struggle is real, my work is constantly bringing in pizza and doughnuts and cookies and whatnot). I also agree with Kelsey, you could try getting him healthier snacks for the drive home so he doesn't buy unhealthy ones. If you're trying to cut carbs, he could have meat sticks or jerky or carrot sticks. If you're just trying to eat healthier overall, he could have trail mix or just pack regular nuts, apples, grapes, banana... ya know. Fruits, nuts, and vegetables make great snacks. Or fruits with nuts like apples + natural peanut butter. Yum! What kind of healthy eating/diet are you trying to encourage? A lot of \"bloat\" or \"stomach\" weight can be lost simply by getting rid of or diminishing sugar intake and processed foods. I swear by the low carb lifestyle but that's more of a lifestyle than a diet, and it's definitely not for everyone! Healthy eating can be something as simple as drinking more water and less soda/coffee, or swapping out a bag of chips for a bag of nuts or an apple. If he is serious about feeling this way, I encourage you to sit down with him and tell him that you don't think that he's fat, but if he wants to lose weight, he has to start paying more attention to what he eats. What we eat is far more crucial to our overall health than what we do. Working out all the time doesn't off-set an unhealthy diet. Exercise is important, but I think swapping his diet should take priority. Whew. Sorry. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk lol",
				"My fianc\u00e9 will bring up that he\u2019s \u201cfat\u201d a couple times a week, I\u2019ve offered to work out with him (I\u2019m a fitness instructor) but he\u2019s not interested. Like you said, he\u2019s a grown ass man, if he wants to do it, he will. The last thing you want is to nag him like you\u2019re his mom. When my fianc\u00e9 says he\u2019s fat, I say he\u2019s gorgeous and I love him but if he wants to work out or wants me to make different meals just let me know and I\u2019ll support him anyway I can. I don\u2019t push the issue",
				"View Quoted Comment So what happens is he has a certain calorie intake that he limits himself too, and a certain calorie limit that he wants to burn everyday. It seems that he's eating the meals I make for him, AND eating something from the catering carts. We occasionally pack baggies of banana chips and pretzels, and he takes a protein bar as a snack. As for diet, it's more vegetables and protein, less sugar and processed stuff. So for lunch he'll have salmon or chicken with vegetables, and with dinner we'll have ground turkey or beef with vegetables. Turkey bacon and eggs in the morning with one or two slices of bread. We drink LOADS of water, but I don't really know how much he's eating at work or what exactly he's eating.",
				"View Quoted Comment Right! I love the man to pieces, and he is relatively healthy overall, but like you said, the last thing I want to do is nag him about goals he set for himself. No one is forcing him, and maybe something will click for him soon. He sees a few pounds of weight loss as progress (which it is!) but then he kind of backtracks with the mindset of, \"I'm doing a good job, I deserve this.\"",
				"View Quoted Comment Hey, sounds like you're doing all you can! Veggies and meat for the win! And congratulations on meeting your goals and eating healthy! Depending on if he's actually overweight vs if he's just outside the normal range for his body type, it'll take a while to lose weight even on a great diet if you guys have been eating better for a while, so I'm not sure he could realistically lose 20 pounds by your wedding date (unless he has a lot of weight to lose), but I think he could feasibly hit 10 if he dedicated himself to the diet and exercise you guys seem to do. I'm with the PPs, you are being AWESOME as a FW and at this point, if he's really upset about his weight, he's gotta face the fact that he has to make a change. You're doing everything in your power.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yeah I definitely hear you. I\u2019d focus on supporting when and where you can and just stay out of it the rest of the time. Like I\u2019d never say \u201care you sure you want to eat that\u201d but i definitely would suggest i make a healthier dinner for both of us like \u201chow about I make this new salmon recipe tonight?\u201d Then it\u2019s more casual and he\u2019s not gonna feel like it\u2019s an attack on his diet or willpower Good luck!",
				"I would ask what he needs from you in order to best help him? Does he need you to play food police or does he just need you to ask if he wants to join for a walk? You might need to set some boundaries around it if it continues where he complains to you but then doesn\u2019t change things which causes you to get frustrated. Because at the end of the day he\u2019s an adult and responsible for himself.",
				"This could be an exact description of my husband. There\u2019s nothing you can do except shop for groceries and cook the best you can. He has to make his own decisions and be responsible for himself. If he doesn\u2019t, he won\u2019t reach his goals and he\u2019ll either learn or continue what he\u2019s doing.",
				"It is impossible to force other people to diet or workout. I would ask him why he wants to lose weight. Maybe he just doesn't want it enough. If he insists he want it, then ask how you can help. It has to come from him or he will continue to cheat.",
				"I totally feel you because I was the same way as your husband. LOL! I grumbled and complained everyday that I was starving. LMAO! But, my hubby still made salads for our lunch and had me eating a healthy dinner and we also went to the gym 3x a week. By the time our honeymoon came I couldn't eat as much as I wanted since my stomach shrank. Now we still go to the gym and eat fairly healthy.",
				"HI, i think all of us wants to loose weight which is the hardest of all. My Fiance- he is so disciplined in going to gym almost everyday and this is nothing new, before I met him he is already going to gym which he said will make him feel better however, he is a meat lover. His work requires physical labor so forget about changing his diet, LOL! he lost 6 lbs and now he gained 3 lbs. His goal is to loose 20 lbs before our wedding in 6 months. We often joked around that we certainly accept the fact that we will loose; \"nothing\" after gym and laughed about it. We often say to each other; \"I am fat\"- then he says' no you're not, and then vice versa!. I think as long as we are happy on that day and hang loose, it should be ok. it takes serious discipline to loose weight. Gym is like our time together- every Sunday we go together and he is expecting that already. He goes 4 a.m. weekdays and I cannot just join him that early, lol! He does watch what he eats and sometimes I am the culprit coz i crave ice cream. But I am trying to be good. I think, it is on him and as long as you don't pressure him then it is pretty much on him if he achieves his goal or not. But again- it is important to be happy",
				"Same thing happened to my husband, but he actually was pretty overweight lol. 18 months before our wedding he was 195lbs and the reason he decided to get in shape was because he wouldn\u2019t let me frame any of our engagement photos because he thought he looked fat in all of them, and then realized he didn\u2019t want to feel that way about our wedding photos too.He started working out on his own for a few months. He\u2019d lose 20lbs then gain 10. Similar to what you\u2019re talking about. When I realized he had completely plateaued and was just going back and forth with weight, I got him a few sessions with my brother\u2019s personal trainer as an early Christmas gift (my brother is really into fitness and I knew his trainer was good, AND that my husband was more likely to go because he could go to some classes with my brother lol).The trainer helped him SO MUCH. By our wedding he was 139lbs and literally had visible abs, which I was totally not expecting \ud83d\ude02 But seriously it was 100% the trainer that made the main difference. Partly because he taught him how to work out better, but honestly I think it was mostly because the trainer held him accountable! I was so sick of \u201cmoming\u201d him, telling him not to have unhealthy snacks, bugging him to go to the gym, etc. The trainer basically did that for me hahaha. He was more likely to listen to the trainer, and I\u2019m sure the trainer gave more qualified advice than me anyway. AND then I didn\u2019t have to be a nag anymore.If you can afford it I\u2019d highly recommend investing in a trainer even just for the couple months before your wedding. It can make a huge difference! At the beginning he was losing 2lbs per week.",
				"I hear you.... although mine needs to shed about 15lbs. He does what yours does...lasts a couple days and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m just letting him go at this point. He needs to get to a point with himself that he doesn\u2019t like and then he\u2019ll work on it. I just focus on shedding a few more myself especially since my dress just came in. Good / Happy times :-)",
				"Well i understand where you are coming from the realization is you might have to ask him if he doesnt want to go to the gym everyday and not snack when are you guys going to get a new suit or exchange the current one?",
				"I was this way with my fianc\u00e9 and he never once said anything to me about it. He heard me say them same things a million time \u201cI\u2019m gonna start a diet tomorrow or I\u2019m gonna actually lose the weight this time.\u201d Except I never did it. Until that last time I said it. It took a lot for me to just own up to it and be like okay for real like this really is that last time I\u2019m saying that and I just did what I had to do and I\u2019m down 30 pounds and counting. I think it would have been harder on me if he would have said something that I already was aware that I was doing \ud83d\ude02 now I\u2019m like wow I said that so many times and he\u2019s just like yeah you did but now look at you! He never once for discouraging and I think everyone he noticed a change he would say something positive. For example I would lose a few pounds and he would make it such a big deal like oh my god you\u2019re killing it babe you\u2019re doing so good keep it up! And if it was the other way around and I gained a pound or whatever he would be like yeah no biggie \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02"

My dress is beautiful and I\u2019m beautiful in it, I just wish I would have taken things a bit more serious as I had PLENTY of time.

Don't stress the small stuff and enjoy the beauty of the wedding itself. I hope it will be a good time.",
				"That is a lot to deal with. I understand. I lost my Dad in the middle of my planning and gained a lot of weight. One quick thing you could probably do to help with a few pounds is a detox. There is a book that is very inexpensive called the 10 Day Smoothie Detox Cleanse by JJ Smith that is really good. It was helpful for me. I didn't do 10 days, I did 5 days and lost 7lbs. I will do it again right before my wedding to lose a couple more. Hopefully this can help for you. I few people I know have done this and the most I've known for someone to lose is 15lbs. I hope this works. Don't feel down. Like you said, \"You are Beautiful. Hold your head up like the Queen you are.",

And that's not even counting ALL the wedding planning that I've been doing mostly alone. So, once he pointed out all the things going on in my life, I felt a bit better about not having time or energy to work on improving my body. He also pointed out that he loves me just the way I am!

I also didn\u2019t fully take things seriously in the right timing i ended up starting to workout in November so its been 3months and I definitely needed more time. My dress fits me almost perfectly because I ordered up a size and I actually gain muscle in my lower body easily. I really wanted my problem areas to look better but they dont. I also recently bought some outfits for my honeymoon and I feel big. Now i have 1 month to go. I still want to try to lose a little weight but now I have to be extra careful because if my legs get bigger my dress wont fit.",

He\u2019s the calm one and I need that so much!!",
				"Pounds don't matter as much as the glow you'll have and the smile on your face when you dance the night away and leave the reception for your honeymoon. You've earned the vacation so enjoy the fact that you successfully put a wedding together (which I'm quickly learning is quite a challenge). Weight comes and goes, but the look you'll have when you're first married is once in a lifetime. Now that's instagram-worthy!",
				"Oh honey, I am sorry for the losses that you and your FH have experienced recently. That being said, I completely understand where you are right now, and I have been feeling the exact same way. While my situation is slightly different, (I'm working full-time, and part-time, working on my BS in nursing, and trying to plan this wedding), I too had the goal of losing weight and was not successful in losing even 1 pound, despite working out for the past year. I know nothing I say can change the way you feel, but please know that you are not alone, that your FH thinks you are beautiful, and that YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL. You do not need to be a size 0 or 4 to be beautiful, you need to be confident. Be confident that despite all of the emotional upset that you have had in your lives recently, you have supported each other and stayed strong together. Go enjoy your wedding and your honeymoon beauty, you will never get this chance again.Blessings and support from a fellow stressed out bride,Kristin",

Maybe experiment with different methods.

				"If you love bread, I would HIGHLY recommend not doing keto or cutting out carbs. If you love it there is no reason you shouldn't be able to eat it (within reason obviously). What has worked best for me is counting my calories and protein! Protein is SUPER important for the 'toning' aspect of weight loss, so without you will get smaller but softer too which isn't going to be helpful for getting a tighter midsection.I also just saw a few comments that recommended cutting calories extremely low, and I just wanted to point out that it is extremely unhealthy to cut calories below 10x your body weight, especially as a female (hormones NEED calories). A good place to start for a weight loss goal is multiply your body weight by 12 then focus on getting your body weight in protein. (Ex I weigh 150 lbs, so I eat 150 g of protein and I eat 1800 calories in a day).I have a few nutrition & weight loss certifications, so if you have any questions feel free to send me a message",
				"I don't cut carbs, only at the end and its a tapered cut. I do healthy carbs: Whole grain oats, sweet potato or red potato, wild rice. No processed carbs, no sugars to very little. Protein, clean proteins. I lost 40 pounds in 7 months and built toned body (aka muscle-which takes up less space then fat) eating this way. Also I weight lift and do cardio. Closer to my wedding date, I will cut the carbs to loose some extra water weight, but I wont cut them this far out. My wedding is in July. Pretty much I am treating this like a weight loss competition, which I have won before! So that's my advice. I also have weight to shred as well, I went off my plan over the holidays and now I got to get refocused, want to be in the best shape ever!",

				"What counts is the marriage, not the wedding. Postponing the wedding indefinitely until you are the weight you want to be a) may not work, and b) leaves you not married for the years it might take even if it does.Your FI loves you as you are now. Presumably, you will invite only guests who care about you as you are now. That's much more important than looking a particular way on your wedding day.",
				"I had a baby a year ago and I\u2019ve barely lost any weight since giving birth. I have 7 months until my first fitting and I\u2019m just starting to get serious about loosing the weight. I\u2019m going to start the keto diet tomorrow in order to loose as much as possible. People from work have done it and it\u2019s worked wonders for them. I know what it\u2019s like for your S/O to tell you they love you no matter what size you are and then you look in the mirror and it tells you otherwise. Tell that voice to STFU and that you\u2019re deserving of love and to be loved and that whether or not you loose 1 pound or 100 pounds you have someone that loves you for you and you live yourself too and that\u2019s enough. Sometimes we are our own worst enemies when it comes to love, relationships and self love. Weighing a certain amount isn\u2019t going to determine your value as a person. But using it as a tool to to hate yourself is. Don\u2019t destroy a good thing because you haven\u2019t figure out how to control every part of who you are. I suggest you get into therapy, the gym, the kitchen and some sort of spiritual guidance to help face your demons. Mind, Body, Spirit you\u2019ve got this. All you have to do is do it. And keep doing it. Your partner loves you. You need to love you too.",
				"Deep breaths! There are plenty of dresses that will fit you no matter your weight! If I can find a dress that flatters me at 285, you certainly can find one. I would start making small changes to start prepping for your goals - cut out soda, no French fries, limited carbs. Or really just start meal prepping and attempting to alter your lifestyle. If you're anything like me, then making a huge change is tough. But I made sure I adjusted my lifestyle instead of treating it like a crash diet. My dad did a lot of crash dieting when I was a kid - he would lose 100 pounds on a shake diet and then start eating again and put it all back. The point is moderation, not completely depriving yourself like a crash diet. Start making small changes and those are easier to stick with. I lost so much weight with no soda alone that my doctor thought I was crash dieting, but I had just altered my diet. I would start making small changes and believe in yourself. You know you got this.",
				"I strongly urge you not to postpone because of your weight. For medical reasons, I\u2019m not at my ideal weight either. So I do totally get how it can make you feel really uncomfortable being the center of attention. But you deserve happiness. You deserve to start your marriage when you\u2019re ready as a couple and you deserve to accept yourself. Your FS and your guests all love you and they will only be seeing how beautiful you look and how in love you are. Don\u2019t wait for something that may never come, it\u2019s not fair to either of you.",
				"I might be biased but I'd wait to get married. I lost 90lbs when I was in HS. I totally understand not wanting to have a wedding when you aren't happy with yourself. Why would you want people looking at you if you don't even like what you see?! I get it! You deserve to feel beautiful and enjoy your wedding. My fear is, you won't and this will be a lifetime regret with photos that you hate. My advice, stop telling yourself it may not happen. You can make it happen. Start with smaller goals. 100lbs seems never ending. Go for 10...then 20...then 40. You WILL get there. Honestly, I'd have a courthouse wedding now and then maybe a \"wedding celebration\" later with a vow renewal and a little reception. Even a few years later would be fine. Then you can celebrate your marriage and your rocking body!",
				"Remember that your worth is not based on your weight or size. As you said, your fianc\u00e9 loves you for who you are. I also am not happy with my size, but I personally would not postpone my wedding for it. I joined Weight Watchers in November and have already lost 28 pounds. Rather than be down on yourself and push things off, commit yourself to healthier choices and exercise. That\u2019s the first step. There will always be some excuse, some stress, some new step in life... Ignore that inner voice, and continue on as planned!",

You definitely want to be comfortable, feel great that day and wear a genuine smile. As for weight loss, I\u2019d really suggest Weight Watchers. It\u2019s a lifestyle change and also changes your mindset on proper, heathy portions and ways to eat. The best part is that it\u2019s not a fad, you get to eat normal food (just healthier choices and better portions) and you get support via meetings and and an app with lots of info, meal ideas and message boards (just like this one). But most of all... it works!",
				"I am also not happy about gaining about 40 lbs in the past maybe 6 years. My fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t know me at my best weight. One night, in frustration, I even told him I wasn\u2019t sure about marrying him if I couldn\u2019t lose weight and that did NOT go over well. He said the same as some above - it\u2019s about the marriage not the weight. But I want to feel good about myself in front of 150+ people. So now I have <6 months to do something about it.

Yes it\u2019s an extra bonus that I will look a little better but I won\u2019t be thin. You can\u2019t put your life on hold so you look a certain way in pictures.

Any progress you make is going to make you feel great! I went through this, as well. I started doing keto a month ago and I\u2019ve already lost 12 lbs and had to have my dress taken it, and that felt great! You just have to withdrawal from sugar and carbs by following the keto diet in combination with intermittent fasting. I usually eat one meal a day, dinner, because it\u2019s easier when I\u2019m busy during the day (my eating period is 1pm-9pm, so I could have lunch and dinner if I want).

I think you should stick to your plan. Just remember HE LOVES YOU AND HE THINKS YOURE GORGEOUS! Trust me!!!!

				"I say you have the wedding! I would take some extra time to find a dress that you love at the weight you are now. He loves you for you and that is way is important. If you end up hating the pictures, have a big vow renewal at 5 or 10 years and go all out!Also, I would google Intuitive Eating (I am reading the F**K It Diet right now). There is no such thing as food addiction and they will help you come to terms with and love the body you have now.",
				"Don't underestimate the results you can get in 7 months!! I don't think you should postpone your wedding, but don't discount what you are able to do before your wedding. Believe in yourself and take it one day at a time I have struggled with weight my whole life too, but by just focusing on more protein and fueling my body with the right foods it started to melt off. Since then I have started studying a lot about nutrition, and it's actually pretty amazing how much you can eat and get results, so don't let a love of food scare you!! If you ever have any questions on a good place to start you can always send me a message!!",
				"I would say start working on yourself now you have 8 months even if you dont lose 100 pounds even losing 40 pounds would make you feel better. dont postpone the wedding just cut out carbs sodas anything thats junk.",
				"First of all, you're absolutely right...he loves you and wants you. :-)It sounds like you're struggling with some things you aren't personally happy with yourself and that frustration, anger, embarrassment, etc. is projecting onto how you're viewing external opportunities. So the solution isn't going to be whether or not you say I do this year or even next year...the solution is with you and you alone. Have you shared your concerns with your FH or someone you love and trust? I've actually been to therapy and have been enjoying the sessions...and the therapy isn't about me getting married at all, it's about the struggle I sometimes have with depression. Mental health is so important and my own weight has been jeopardized because I tend to put a lot on myself...the superwoman syndrome."

I went to my OBGYN today to discuss options and i was put on a low dosage birth control. (I have never had good experience with any birth control i have tried in the past) but i'm hopeful. My OBGYN was not much help to me as far as talking to me. My question is...Do i take the packs as directed and THEN the last month skip the sugar pills and go straight to the new pack to try to skip my period? Or did i skip ALL sugar bills for 3 months? Has anyone have an successes of this working?",

				"I'd ask your doctor what is best for you out of those two options. Some people skip the placebo week and still get their period.",

				"Either option works, but I would check with your doctor and see what they recommend. It\u2019s not unsafe to continuously skip the sugar pills as you aren\u2019t getting a real period on birth control.",
				"It's definitely best to ask your doctor, but you shouldn't need to skip your placebo pills for 3 months to skip one period.",
				"Thanks everyone! I wanted to get different people's opinions considering the OBGYN i went to was not much help to me. I will be finding another.",
				"I would check with your doctor or a pharmacist. Usually when I skip one placebo week I still get it, you can also just do the placebo week a week earlier if that makes sense. Or skip the placebos for two months, but I wouldn\u2019t do it for 3",
				"I would just do the last month, or you could try skipping the placebos the first month and seeing if that would make you get your next one a week earlier?",
				"You could also ask for the kind that is 3 months long and just start it a month from now.",
				"Well I tried asking the OBGYN When starting the first pack if I could take it a week earlier(or later) than should be to maybe throw off my cycle but he said that wouldn\u2019t be a good idea.",
				"Is your birth control only progesterone or combined estrogen and progesterone? Don't skip all three months. Skip only the placebo ones in the last month, cause if it has estrogen if, by any chance you ovulate, you'll end up getting a heavy period.",
				"I always get my period the Wednesday of the placebo week. A couple months ago I realized my period was going to come when we were on vacation in Florida later this month. So I skipped a week between packages to push my period back a week. I should now get my period after we come home. I just made sure to use alternative contraception for a few weeks.",
				"I feel for ya. According to my tracker I will be as well",
				"View Quoted Comment He put me on Lo Loestrin (haven't started it yet) But it is a combination of both",
				"View Quoted Comment Yeah only skip the placebo of the last month, but start taking it months in advance so that if you get any breakthrough bleeding he can switch it up to a higher dose by the time your wedding comes.",
				"View Quoted Comment Thanks! We are getting married in May so i'm stressing about this working. Birth Control in the past ( Low dosage) always gave me breakthrough bleeding and terrible side effects. I hope this one works okay for me",
				"Well first I would never want to give medical advice as I am not a doctor, however from the 10 plus years I've taken some form of BC they say that there is no medical necessity to have a period. I am SO scared that I'll get my period too! But I'm on the sugar pill and it's been less than 2 months and by month 3 I shouldn't have one anymore. Good luck!",
				"The birth control he put me on his Lo Loestrin FE and there is only 2 sugar pills...Is this normal? Previous birth control years ago they had usually a weeks worth",
				"This is what I'm so nervous about. I use an APP too to track mine and I'm not on birth control because I've had SUCH terrible reactions to the pill, the patch, the ring and I was just a bit too nervous to try the IUD. My body is a mess...but so far so good, but with wedding stress and exercise, I may need to come back to this thread and see these options through for myself if my period ends up starting on my wedding day!!!!!"

It's super easy to use, though. Comes with a little squishy bite tray and gel. I brush my teeth, pop it in before my shower and rinse when I'm done with my shower. Works for me! It helped save me from cavities when I was afraid to go to the dentist for four years. Good luck with whichever you choose!",
				"I've tried Crest White Strips before and they do work. There are a number of similar products on the market as well, including more \"natural\" versions. I'm going to start using a charcoal toothpaste in the mornings (I use a high-fluoride prescription toothpaste at night) and closer to the wedding will either try some sort of whitening strips or have considered giving \"hi smile\" or something similar a go. I'll probably just stick with strips because I know they work and don't need the extra clutter or expense of a UV whitening kit in my house.Has anyone had any luck convincing their SO to try whitening with them? My FH drinks coffee and has pretty stained teeth but an amazing smile. I'd like us both to try to whiten our teeth a bit before our big day (especially since I'll be wearing an ivory dress and him a white shirt) but I feel like when I first mentioned it to him he wasn't buying into the idea, and I don't want him to think I'm superficial or don't like his teeth, just that it makes sense to be a little bit extra for our wedding day, since using some strips at home isn't too difficult or expensive and will result in some improvements."

			"content": "Hi Everyone, So I am officially 77 days away - G's this is coming fast!!!! This past weekend i went to do my first fitting ( a little afraid i went to soon) but after being resized they told me i lost a inch and a half around waist and hips. So my dress had to be taken in a bit. I am not mad about it being taken in because its makes it hug my body way better than it did previously. My concern is the wedding isn't until 3/30 this year for the past two weeks i haven't had carbs or sugar and no meat the last week. I plan to add these things back to my diet soon but not crazy as sugar and carbs add to the fat where we don't want it. I'm just nervous how to maintain this exact weight for so long - also take note i was working out and stopped (squats, leg press and etc) i stopped because had i had a scare at the gym with a creep and haven't had time to pick a new location. Any suggestions - my next fitting is 2/1 -- truly stressed to stay this weight cause i loved how everything looked Saturday vs. how its been when the dress initially came in. Thanks for any advice",
			"comments": [
				"I would look online at a TDEE calculator and try to eat around that many calories to maintain. Eating or not eating sugar or carbs won\u2019t make a difference as weight loss comes from eating less calories than you\u2019re burning regardless of the source. If your weight does fluctuate some I\u2019m sure your seamstress can make adjustments, mine was still changing my dress the week of my wedding.",
				"I would also schedule another fitting 1-2 weeks out from your wedding so you can do any final alterations needed.",
				"View Quoted Comment I will have to look that up thanks. OMG until the week of is insane lol I am going crazy like how did i get this small - its great but now im like can i maintain this. Thanks for the info definitely will look up the TDEE calculator",
				"View Quoted Comment My next fitting is for the hem and bustle but I agree i hope a fitting can be done closer as it seems not much else is planned to be done after the hem which still leaves a lot of time between the wedding date and proposed completion.",
				"I agree that the best way to maintain weight is to keep track of your calories. I recommend the app myfitnesspal. They will calculate how much calories you need a day in order to maintain/lose/gain weight. Whenever you eat, just input the food information and the app will help you keep track. Good luck!",
				"First, screw that creep at the gym. I HATE when anyone makes a woman feel uncomfortable or unsafe especially when she is trying to improve/maintain her health and do something that is good for her and makes her happy. I really hope you can find an environment to exercise in where you feel empowered and not like you need to be on guard.Second, I think it would be smart to take your own measurements and track your progress. Know what your measurements currently are, as as you reintroduce foods and increase caloric intake monitor how you feel and how that impacts your body. If you stay in tune with how your inputs/outputs impact your size, shape, and how you feel, you can then make small adjustments and tweak your routine to get you into an ideal \"maintenance\" mode. Whatever changes you do, make them small at first and avoid anything drastic, like going from avoiding sweets to having dessert every night of the week.Also weight training burns calories and increases muscle density and mass, so stopping weight training might actually result in changes to your metabolism or shape in addition to any dietary changes. I would recommend as much as possible to avoid doing both changes at once. Until you can find another gym I would definitely encourage you to continue to do body weight exercises - stuff like body weight squats, lunges, bulgarian split squats, step-ups, etc can all be done at home with minimal equipment or no equipment. Doing this will at least keep your muscles awake and active until you can find a new gym where you feel safe and welcome."

				"I don\u2019t have an arm implant, but I do have an IUD and it was the best decision I ever made. Mirena, with hormones, lasts 5 years, or there is a non-hormonal one that lasts for 10. Discomfort during the insertion, followed by bad cramping throughout the day, but I was fine by the next day. Added plus is I don\u2019t get a period anymore, although not everyone experiences that. You can also have it removed at any time if you decide you want to have children. I know not exactly what you asked for, but it is a great birth control option!",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you for your response! I've looked into IUDs and I'll have to keep that in mind!",
				"View Quoted Comment Def look into it! I was so nervous about it at first, but it is SO worth it. I just got my second one this past January \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
				"I have the arm implant and it took about a week for the bruising to go away and that bandage strips were on for at least three days. So if you get it three days before you may have bruises in your pictures.",
				"I think bruising and swelling is common with the arm implant. Look into an IUD and talk all the options over with your doctor. I would strongly recommend against changing your birth control methods before your wedding, the last thing you want is a hormone change!",
				"I would wait until after the wedding. I heard there is bad bruising with arm implant, and I bled for almost two weeks after my IUD was inserted.",
				"I don't have the implant but do have the 10 year IUD (copper). I absolutely don't recommend it, it's the most vicious shark week. Unless you already have super light periods it's not worth it. I still have 5 years left on it but will probably switch soon either to Mirena or the implant. Also if you do get an IUD, the insert process isn't the greatest. It will give you the worse cramps of your life. All that being said, an IUD is worth it just not to have to think about, but it's a process. My only concern with the implant is I heard there's a higher chance of gaining weight on it. Anyone have this experience?",
				"I have had the arm implant for 3 years now and I am anemic (low iron so I bruise easily) and I barely had any bruising or swelling when I had it done! There was a bandage on it for 12 hours.. it felt a little sore, kinda like when you give blood.. The only thing I would say is that the hormones for me kicked in pretty quick and it makes me very emotional and bloated.. other than that I LOVE it !! \ud83d\ude0a",
				"I haven\u2019t had an implant, but I have an IUD and I would NOT recommend getting it right before the wedding. I also second other posters responses about not changing up your hormones right before the wedding.",
				"Definitely don't get the IUD any time close to the wedding. I got mine and my body rejected it and pushed it down in to my uterine wall. It was very painful and I had to have it removed 48 hours after getting it in.",
				"I don\u2019t have an implant since my system is pretty sensitive and there can sometimes be reactions to it but i used to do the pill and switched to the birth control patch a while ago!",
				"Don\u2019t mess with your hormones the week of your wedding!! Not only could you have emotional changes, you could also break out, have cramping or bleeding. You also won\u2019t know if it\u2019s something you\u2019re going to have a bad reaction to. Not a good idea at all. I had a Mirena for years, I actually was on my second when I had my tubes removed. I had no problems with it. I know that there are a lot of options for IUDs out there now. Just make sure you do your research, especially if you haven\u2019t had children yet.",
				"I have the arm implant and it left a bruise that took a while to heal. I would REALLY try to avoid getting an implant that close to the wedding because there\u2019s a real chance you\u2019ll have a bruise. Overall I really like the implant and I\u2019ll probably be getting another one but the timing might not work in your situation.",
				"View Quoted Comment That's what I was worried about Thank you for letting me know!",
				"View Quoted Comment You definitely bring up a great point! I'm leaning more toward waiting until after the wedding now",

				"View Quoted Comment If you don't mind me asking, has the patch worked well for you?",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you for your advice! I definitely think I won't mess with switching methods until after the wedding",
				"I refuse to use birth control after some bad experiences. So I wont advise against them because you may not have a reaction. But be cautious of ALL the health issues that birth control can cause. The last thing you need is a hospital visit right before your wedding.",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank your for sharing your experience with the implant! I really think I'll wait until after the wedding to change birth control methods. I appreciate the feedback!",
				"View Quoted Comment It has! it\u2019s super convenient for me and has been good for traveling and other plans as well. My body adjusted super well to it as well.",
				"I love my implant so much but def would wait if I were you. My bruise was horrible. I seriously had to wear a jacket for like a week and a half because it was my entire bicep. At work my boss pulled me aside and asked if everything was okay \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f So worth it but definitely worth waiting until after your wedding.",
				"I have the Mirena IUD. I have had it since my daughter was born 4 years ago. I love it. My friend is actually going to her OB this week for the implant!!!! I will keep you posted and give you all the info she gets lol",
				"View Quoted Comment I'll have to look into the patch! I'm glad you found a great method",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you for your reply! I'm definitely going to wait until after my wedding to change my BC!",
				"View Quoted Comment I appreciate your feedback! And thank you - I hope it goes great for your friend",
				"Not for the arm implant, but I did the shots for 9 or so months and it was the worst mistake I've ever made. It was detrimental to my estrogen & caused a lot of problems going forward that I'm still doing with. So again, I can't speak for the implant but I know personally I'll never use anything beyond the pill again.",
				"View Quoted Comment I'm sorry you had that bad experience! Thank you for letting me know about your experience",
				"My cousin had it and it was a NIGHTMARE. I have heard from other multiple people that they had terrible experiences with it, so I'd maybe recommend a different option.I had the Mirena IUD for 3 years and I never had any issues at all. The insertion was very unpleasant so I'd definitely take pain meds for the cramping and have someone with you to take you to/from appointment!",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you for the feedback!",
				"Implanon in the arm made me suicidal.... I have heard the same from several people.... I have heard positive things about IUD's though",
				"I have the NuvaRing and it is so easy. I have ADD, so it's hard for me to remember a pill every day; you insert it for three weeks, remove it for one to have a period, then start over. It's low dose, too, so it doesn't exacerbate my hormone-induced migraines. I would try this out and then transition to a more permanent solution after the wedding. I don't know you heal, so I'm suggesting this as an alternative to an invasive procedure. Good luck with whatever you decide to do.",
				"My friend got an implant and she had this gigantic bruise. Her sister had the same and it made her have a terrible reaction. Obviously other women get implants with no issues but I do know this could be a possibility",
				"I had the implant and it was awful. While it did it's job and I did not get pregnant, the side effects are awful. I had horrific mood swings, depression, and awful weight gain, I hate to be this person but I think it also messed with my metabolism. Prior to getting the implant I was always a steady 130-135lbs (I'm 5'6) I gained 20lbs over the 2 years I had the implant and even a year after having it removed I cannot lose weight and have gained another 10lbs.",
				"I have a copper IUD (Paragard) and IMO it's the best form of birth control and perfect for me. IUDs are super effective, and Paragard uses no hormones and lasts 10-12 years. It's a small copper \"t\" shaped coil that is inserted into your uterus and prevents an egg from implanting in your uterine lining. Once inserted, you literally don't have to do anything. I'm currently 34, and had my first IUD implanted when I was 20.Personally, I didn't want hormones at all because I have enough hormones, and didn't want any of the side effects associated with hormonal birth control. My mom had a copper IUD for many years, and then when she decided she wanted a kid she had it removed and conceived me right away. The fact that she never got pregnant with one and it didn't impact her fertility at all convinced me it was the right option for me. IUDs are also the longest lasting form of non-permanent birth control, so after the initial cost and discomfort you really don't have to worry about anything for years.Personally, I wouldn't start any new form of birth control 3 days before the wedding."

I'd cut things like snacking, desserts, soda, coffee creamer, etc. and other unnecessary calories. Focus on healthy snacking & healthy meals, and drinking a lot of water. I'd look into doing some at home workouts 2-3 times a week as well.",

				"If your diet is on point (make sure you are getting enough calories and in healthy/whole foods), next check water intake and up it a lot.I also cannot recommend weight training enough - I am going to assume that you don't necessarily want to lose 25 lb to fit into a piece of luggage or something, you want your dress to look attractive on you and maybe have a smaller waist or something. Get on the leg press and work from bodyweight presses up. I found that once I started deadlifting squatting and benching, my muscle mass started to grow and I burn calories like a furnace.",

They have an online only version that is $20 a month where you sign up and get the app, so you can log all your food. It\u2019s super easy to track points, I find it so much easier to do that then track calories. It has a huge section of recipes and food, and a great online community. I def recommend it!",
				"So I gained the freshman 15...ehhh 20... my Sophomore year of college. I was at my heaviest and decided to make a change. A coworker of mine recommended that I look into Whole30. I ended up doing it (while going to the gym 4-5 times a week) and lost all the weight in the 30 days. I won't say it was easy because it definitely wasn't. There is a lot of planning and prepping involved but there are also SO MANY benefits. I cut a lot of bad habits out (soda, creamer in my coffee everyday, fast food) and have stuck with them for the past few years. If you're truly dedicated to losing the weight, I strongly urge you to look into it! I'd be more than happy to be your accountability partner",
				"Be REALLY disciplined about cutting carbs and sugar!!! I promise you, it makes all the difference. Good luck!!",
				"Switch out your lunch with cucumbers, with fresh lemons and tomatoes. Eating cucumbers and drinking more water, will actually reduce water bloat.

Your goal is absolutely achievable but their is no magic or fancy diet or routine that will get you there. A 500 calorie deficit and a periodised weights and cardio program is all you need. You just need to have timed refeed days to avoid stalling. With added cardio you will lose around 1.5lbs a week (with some more weight coming from water loss). Losing weight is simple maths and if you follow the right formula you will be guaranteed to reach your goal!Good luck!!!!!Let me know if you want more info!",
				"Diet and water!! I recommend Noom because it's just very simple as opposed to macro tracking, etc. for a quick fix. And you always need more water!! Good luck!",
				"For general weight loss, I recommend WW (formally weight watchers). Go to meetings. It will keep you accountable and give you support along the way. To hit your goal, you need to be losing around 2 lbs a week, which is on the high side for any diet program. For WW, I would not use any of my extra weekly points or work out points if you are trying to lose that quickly. I would also increase your working out if possible to 3-4 days a week. Even if it is just an extra 30 minute walk. I know you are active a work, but anything extra helps.",

Limit your sugar to fruits only, and cut soda. Find out how many calories you should be getting per day (My Fitness Pal is a good source) and cut that number by 400 for weight loss.

You can also do that before every meal so you know you\u2019re drinking at least 30 ounces a day! If you don\u2019t already, get a water bottle with little hash marks indicating how many ounces it holds. That way you can see exactly how much water you\u2019re drinking. Also, if you work at a desk, it\u2019s super easy to fill it up and keep it on your desk all day! That way, you\u2019re reminded to drink something, and soon all those sips add up and you have to refill it! But, if you feel really full, don\u2019t force yourself to drink it. Finally, if drinking plain water gets boring, you can always infuse it with fruit or veggies or flavor it with a couple squirts of a flavor enhancer! Just check to make sure there\u2019s no added sugars (I personally like Mio). Good luck!",
				"View Quoted Comment I have tried that, but still fail to drink when needed due to not feeling thirsty...so its out of my mind.",

What helps me is either setting alarms to remind me to drink water, or getting one of those bottles that has times written on it (so you know to drink this much by 9 AM, this much by lunch, etc.). I also noticed putting fruit in my water makes me more likely to drink it. I got in a routine of drinking a glass of water when I wake up and right before bed, so that was helpful since even though I wasn't thirsty it was just routine.",
				"I'm the same way. A friend that works in fitness said what she does is each time she goes to drink water she drinks for 5+ seconds instead of just taking a sip. Taking constant sips wasn't working for me because I don't feel consistently thirsty so I forget so drinking more at once is helping me get more water in. I've been able to drink 6 bottles (12 cups) of water a day by doing this!",
				"I have a cup with a straw at my desk. I usually make sure I fill it up right after work and put it right in front of me. Because I really don't do much at work, I will generally rest my chin on my lid and just keep the straw right in front of my face. Which pretty much forces me to remember to drink some water.",

				"Yes! There are apps that remind you to drink water! But I always ignored them. LOL I'm the worst. I also have trouble drinking water. I'm never thirsty either and sometimes the smell of water makes me feel nauseous. I find it easier to drink if there's a flavor enhancer in it, or if I use a straw. And I LOVE that carbonated waters are big again because they're so easy to find and it sort of tricks me into thinking I'm drinking a soda but without all the sugar so I get my hydration in.Just like you, I can't just drink water on an empty stomach - it hurts my guts LOL. So I will have a little something to eat and then have a glass of water/carbonated water. Also, keep ice around. Like crunchy ice! Ice is just water and chewing on it will help get some extra oz. of water in you, too.I find that a rewards system works for me. Like... \"I can have that square of chocolate if I drink this glass of water first.\" or \"When I finish drinking this bottle of water, I can start binge watching on Hulu, and not a moment sooner.\" When I reward myself for good behavior I stick to it more often than not. Pretty soon, I just got used to having a bottle of water before settling in with the TV at night, and I definitely remind myself I need water if I'm going to \"misbehave\" by eating junk food.",

				"I had this same issue! I never felt thirsty but it what I started doing was when my mind was telling me two sips was enough, I just pushed on to keep drinking. When I get hungry, I keep drinking water first. You will start to feel bloated but that's fine cause you pee it all out lol!",

I bought myself a carry around thermos that holds the amount of water that I am supposed to drink daily and I begin after my coffee and ended after my dinner I don't ever get thirsty either and so I totally struggle like you do. I was told that in most cases when I think I am hungry I am actually thirsty but I don't know the difference I have noticed that since I have increased my water I have decreased food intake and my portions are being controlled because the water keeps me full.",
				"View Quoted Comment I've been trying to make it more like a \"challenge\" for myself. My water bottle has lines to show how many oz of water is in it and now I have started pushing myself trying to \"beat\" my last drink...so if the last time I drank 2oz I try to get 3-4oz in my next drink.",
				"If you start to feel thirty, then you\u2019re already dehydrated. I used to be bad at drinking enough water too, but I definitely notice improvements when I drink more. Setting reminders is a great idea. I have a 21 oz water bottle I try to finish before I eat lunch. Then I try to finish a second bottle before I leave work and a third before bed. You could also try eating more foods that contain water, like watermelon (or any melon).",
				"Set specific \"water goals\" throughout the day. Some easy ways to incorporate this are: - Drink 8-16 oz water as soon as you get up in the morning (pre-coffee if you need the motivation lol)- Drink 8 oz of water each hour you are awake (set an alarm on your phone if you need to!)- Drink 16 oz of water before each meal (similar to the coffee...\"I won't eat lunch until this cup of water is gone\" can be a huge motivator when you're getting hungry)- Buy a water bottle and keep it with you all the time, you'll be more likely to drink if it's always available- put fresh lemon, berries, cucumber, etc. into the water for added flavor (or pick up the crystal light flavor packets at the store!)",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you for this just download it I drink the bare minimum to keep me alive basically and I have to drink more water because my body feels like garbage. I feel better already. Just watered my plant for the first time lol",
				"Same! I can't drink water from a bottle to save my life BUT started keeping one of those 24 oz Starbucks cups with a straw with me, filled with water at all times and noticed myself reaching for it a lot. Now I can't go anywhere without it. I bring water bottles with me (when there's no fountain available) and pour it into the cup. For some reason that really helped a lot."

It honestly all went away once i saw my groom waiting for me. There\u2019s really no advice to give except for to confide in someone and to try and take care of yourself in the best way that you can. You can also open up to your photographer and let them know where you\u2019re at. I\u2019ve found vulnerability in these situations can be really rewarding because then you\u2019ve communicated and everyone knows where you\u2019re at.",
				"Instead of posed photos try doing the candid shots of you enjoying yourself. But I would talk to photographer and do an engagement phot shoot so you get more comfortable in front of him. And if you have time some therapy so your comfortable on your wedding day. You\u2019ll be beautiful.",
				"I am so sorry you are experiencing this! My first suggestion would definitely be to have an \u201cunplugged\u201d ceremony. This has become very popular lately with the rise of social media. I have seen people do signs at their ceremony and reception requesting no photographs/videos by the guests. They usually say something like \u201c The couple requests you to be fully present with them during this special time\u201d then goes on to request they leave all photos and video recordings to the professionals. I have also seen couples have their officiant announce before the ceremony begins that there will be no photos/videos. As far as a professional videographer goes.. since you would like everything recorded, I would go ahead and get the videographer. You don\u2019t have to watch the video immediately following the wedding if you think it will be triggering. It would be really sweet to put the video away in a box along with your wedding vows, then the two of you could read your vows & watch the wedding video on your one year anniversary. Or, if you aren\u2019t ready at that time, you can make it your five year anniversary, or even 10 year anniversary! If history has taught me anything, it is that you always look back at yourself and realize you were thinner/more beautiful than you ever realized at that time. And, at the end of the day, you are marrying the love of your life! He obviously finds you incredibly beautiful, and will undoubtably that day especially. So drop the unrealistic expectations of perfection on your wedding day, and just allow yourself to drown in the happiness of the event!"

You don't need to diet, just substitute for healthier stuff, e.g. replace the carbs in your meal with more veg, have fruit salads instead of unhealthy desserts, only cook with meat under 5% fat (if you eat meat!). I've lost 20lbs in the last six months from eating better alone! If you have access to the gym, as little as half an hour of cardio a day can also help. Exercises like situps or crunches are also really helpful- even if they don't help you lose weight, building up core muscles will improve your figure and posture. Try some methods to reduce water retention- the difference can be small, but dramatic!If you're going down the workout route, maybe consider measuring your waist as well as your weight- muscle weighs much more than fat, so you can tone up and slim down without the scale budging!",

Mind you only for a couple of days. Is a detox type thing. My mom does an egg and meat (if you're not vegan or anything) detox for a couple of days as well. Avoiding carbs and any lactose. I mean... Don't go to extremes where you can't even function but if you're comfortable with something and you know it will work.A detox to the start of your diet sets a pace a little easier than just full on diet for the get go.

				"Keto! Watch dr. Ken Berry's youtube videos. That's what helped me start. Don't listen to anyone who tries to sell you stuff for it. Keto is not a program. It's a lifestyle. I've lost 28lbs in 4.5 months and dropped 2 pants sizes. I actually tried on a size 6 dress when I went wedding dress shopping last month. I also jog or walk each day and lift light weights 3-4 days a week. And please keep an open mind. people will try to tell you that keto is unhealthy, but when you cut down your carbs and consume healthy fats, you'll quickly lose weight and it helps with any inflammatory condition you might have. For me, that was plantar's fasciitis which is pain in the heels of my feet. It sidelined my running. After my plantars went away, I was able to train and recently completed a half-marathon course 19 minutes faster than 4 years before when I ran that race. I also joined the \"Keto for Beginners\" facebook group. Good luck!",
				"View Quoted Comment It is worth a mention that keto can take months to start working for some people, despite it only taking a few days for many. My fiance and I tried it for 5 months (under 15g carbs a day), he followed it loosely and went down a couple of sizes, I followed it religiously and gained 40lbs. This was on top of an hour a day every day at the gym. Almost certainly worth it in the long run, but don't be disheartened if there's no positive difference in the first few months.",

Make your healthy carbs BALANCE the rest of your diet, not overwhelm them. Cut out all the processed crap. Drink water. Seriously. It will help to flush your body of the crap in your system. Your skin will be better too. If you get hungry - drink water first, then eat a vegetable. If you don't want the veggie, you're not 'HUNGRY' you're having a craving. Suck it up.",

			"content": "Hi fellow wedding planners!I got engaged in October of 2019 and our wedding is in July 2020. We have a budget of $20k, which I thought was plenty until I actually started pricing things. My family lives overseas, and I don't have any close friends in the area, so I'm mostly on my own to plan this wedding and it's been causing me a lot of anxiety. Usually I can \"sweat it out\" (that's what got me through college), but the past few months the anxiety has been keeping me up at night. Any advice on anxiety-management?",
			"comments": [
				"I deal with chronic anxiety too! Take deep breaths and only worry about the tasks that you need to do today. I stressed myself out by looking at tasks that needed to be done 2 to 3 months out when I was 6 months out from the wedding. Take lavender baths and do some things that relax you. As far as pricing is concerned, there are ways to cut so just breath. I'm doing my wedding for $10,000, 150 guests. I can give budget cutting advice if you want. $20,000 is certainly enough to have a beautiful wedding!",
				"What specifically are you anxious about? Once you pinpoint that, take a step back and truly analyze it. You\u2019ll see that in the grand scheme of things, no aspect of wedding planning is life or death. Also, anxiety can be reduced by simply having a wedding that you can afford and fits within $20k (which might mean reducing the guest count, selecting certain venues and certain vendors).",
				"I get the anxiety and it does suck how expensive things really are. Like the ladies have said pinpoint your worries and also take a step back and plan little by little. I hope I do not sound harsh but something to tell yourself is that the wedding is one day. IMO do not go into debt over it. You can easily reduce the budget like the others have said. Pinterest has been helpful for me. There are articles or blogs what give great tips on how to cut back. The biggest expenditure will be the reception. I think focus on the aspect that you are marrying the love of your life and that is what makes the day special...not how much you spend. Many of us have thought of our dream wedding but sadly it can be so expensive. 20K is definitely an amount you can work with. Start by looking for affordable venues with reasonably priced catering or you could find a venue that will allow outside caterers. Another option is to look at parks or beaches or gardens for the ceremony as some of them are fairly affordable then do the reception at a restaurant or cater and book a place with a kitchen. Look at country clubs too because some are not too bad. My friend said her wedding was $5,000 and she had the ceremony and buffet reception at a country club. Consider having the wedding on a day that is not Friday or Saturday. I hope this helps and don't let this stress you out. If it does, take a step back and have a nice glass of wine and spend quality time with friends or your FH.",
				"View Quoted Comment I'm not sure where your friend got married, but the cheapest venue I could find in Maryland for an evening wedding was $5,000. Weekday wedding venues are still around $3,000.",
				"View Quoted Comment Hi Kelsie! We're only inviting 100 people. From all the research I've done, venues are between $5k and $6k, photographers (we want a decent one) are at around $3k. Catering is at least $5k for a buffet-style meal, potentially double that (linens and china included), and DJs are looking to be a little over $1k. I'm planning on getting my dress at a second-hand store so hopefully it won't be as expensive as it could be! I'd love whatever advice you have! We're going to make all of our decorations ourselves.",
				"View Quoted Comment I've been looking everywhere for cost-effective catering, but it's proving incredibly difficult to keep it both affordable and not tacky. I think what I'm most anxious about is the weather. We have a tent company on standby, but I'm really hoping it's a nice day!",
				"View Quoted Comment Florida...Tampa Bay. Is that $5,000 just for the ceremony or ceremony and reception? There are some that price here in Florida too lol.",
				"View Quoted Comment For both, and it's on the cheaper end for Maryland. I've contacted every venue I can find and they're all in the range of $5-8k. The more expensive ones are $8-13k. Most venues require you to use their catering or a caterer from their pre-approved list. Some have minimum catering charges.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yeah that is what I have encountered. May I ask how many people you plan to invite? If it is a very small wedding then $5,000 would be too much but if it is in the double digits then it might be worth it depending what it comes with.",
				"View Quoted Comment 100 people!",
				"View Quoted Comment Honestly if it is $5K at the venue for ceremony and that includes the reception that is not a bad price. Does that reception price come with food. Even $10K could be good for 100 people and it still gives you $10K to spare. I am not trying to give you more anxiety but venues are not cheap so if you want to stick within budget you should start with which portions of the wedding are most important (photography, venue, etc...) and budget for that. I am sure in Maryland there are some more budget friendly venue. Have you checked hotels or even outside places like gardens or rooftops?",
				"View Quoted Comment What kind of venue are you wanting and looking at? I know not everyone has this option for them, but we reserved our reception at my parent's church and they are only asking $100. My ceremony venue fee is waived because I used to work there, but if it wasn't waived it would have been $1,200 for a 3 hour reservation at a Chapel on Penn State's campus. When it comes to venues, you may be able to find something that is still beautiful that isn't advertised a lot for weddings and that will bring the price down. $3k is perfect for the photographer! I wouldn't skimp on that. I'm paying $2k and it is worth every penny since you will be looking at the photos for the rest of your life. The catering I've heard is about $5k. What we are doing is we have a close family friend who is a fantastic cook. She is catering our wedding and only charging us for the food. We are doing a buffet style taco bar for 150 guests and she estimates about $600 for everything. I'm paying her an extra $200 as a gift. But we are saving thousands. If you don't have a friend, there may be a great caterer out there who is cheaper. I feel like $5k is slightly pricey for 100 people buffet style. But that also depends on what kind of food you're wanting. Also, I don't know what look you are going for with dinnerware, but we opted out of glass. We are doing the fancy plastic and we're ordering it from amazon. It will be around $400. We are putting a couple of bells on the tables for guests to ring when they want us to kiss. Saving a lot there! Another way to cut costs is to not rent tables unless your venue doesn't come with them. I wanted circular, but our venue only has rectangular. So I switched up my centerpieces and went with the rectangular. We are also making our own dance floor out of vinyl wood, you that fake stuff that pieces together , for $350. That's a 20 x 25, which we would have had to rent for $1500. I'm using my old dance instructor who also DJs weddings as my DJ. Because I know him, he is giving me a discount. I'm only paying $600 for 5 hours. So probably, $1k for a DJ is about right. But you might be able to find a friend to do that too. I was in a wedding where the DJ was a friend of the couple and it was great! Stationary is a great place to cut costs! I got 100 save the dates from shutterfly with 6 pics on them for $101 I believe. It wasn't over $130. Then I got a digital download of my invitation from Etsy for $19 and I will print myself at home. The invitation paper with the envelopes, 100 count, was $20 at Joanns. (Joanns has some great wedding things btw. So does hobby lobby). The rsvp card I got from etsy as well for $4. It's a digital download and I'll print it. The envelopes for those I will get from walmart for around $6 for a 100 count. The stamps are going to be the most expensive thing we pay for. I got 180 or so for $101. I'm not stamping the rsvp envelope to help save some money there. Are you having flowers? I know some great ways to save on that too!",
				"View Quoted Comment Hi Kelsie!We want the ceremony and reception to be in the same place. The venue we found isn't primarily a wedding venue, so it's the cheapest around (Maryland is one of the most expensive states to get married in). They have a flat fee, so there's no price differential between doing the ceremony somewhere else and doing it there. It's good to know that that's a fair price for a photographer! I definitely do not want to skimp on that! Is it worth getting a package that includes a professional photo book, or would it be best just to make our own on Shutterfly?Thankfully I was referred to a great caterer who can work with our budget! The places I had talked to before were charging $13/pp for china alone! He charges $3 for all china needed (plates. flatware, cups, mugs, etc.). He also doesn't charge extra for a champagne toast or cake cutting! Such a relief! A friend from church referred us to a DJ, but they're still over $2k. I'm not great at \"shopping\" for a DJ because I have no idea what I'm looking for. Ability to mix songs is less important to me than the energy and vibe that they bring. Because the engagement is relatively short, would it be tacky to skip the save the dates and just send out invitations a little early? We're only inviting 100 people and 80% of them are family who have already been told when the wedding is. That would save us money on postage (although perhaps that's getting too stingy, as in the scheme of things, $100 is not a substantial expense)We'll have bouquets. I'm thinking of doing wooden flowers. For the decorative pieces, we'll do affordable greenery. I was told that it's best to go to a grocery store florist, as opposed to a stand-alone professional. Would you agree?Thanks!",
				"View Quoted Comment Hi!! Yes, Maryland is expensive! If your venue is between $5k and $6k for your ceremony and reception, I don't think that is a bad price. Especially being a flat fee. Does anything else come with that, or is that just for the space? Yes, you can get a great photography package with $3k! You might pay more for the book if you go through the photographer. We got a photo book for maybe $50 through shutterfly. It was really easy for us to do that though because our photographer uploaded our photos onto shutterfly. We have our own little website on there. But it should still be easy for you and I loved making the book with my fiance! It was so fun!$13 pp!!! What!?!? That's crazy!! I'm glad you found a great caterer! Is that the $5k one? $3 pp for all of the china is a fantastic price!! $2k I feel is pricey, but that also depends on what they come with. Does the DJ have lighting that they bring or does your venue supply that? I totally understand the vibe and energy. I would maybe keep looking to see if you can find a cheaper DJ. Our DJ is allowing us to pick all of our songs, so he isn't doing the mixing so much as helping the flow of the reception and keeping the vibe. Our reception is more relaxed. We aren't really the hype party people. As ballroom dancers, we want something more relaxed.For Maryland, flowers will certainly be different than my experience. We are getting married in PA. I was referred from someone at church (maybe ask around church) a local stand alone florist who is doing 4 bridesmaids bouquets, one bride bouquet, 5 corsages, 11 boutonnieres, 10 hydrangea balls for the pews, a unity candle arrangement, and 19 greenery garland centerpieces. Our flowers are hydrangea and roses. Delivery and set up included, we're paying $1300. So super affordable for everything we're getting! And then we don't have the stress of worrying about it. A grocery store florist might be cheaper. You will want to ask if they deliver because if not, plans will have to be made for that. You can buy flowers in bulk from Sams, and do them yourself. I was going to do that, but I was stressing out from trying to choose. And that was going to be about the same price as the florist I found. I will say, that finding flowers that have volume to the buds, like hydrangeas, will help keep costs down because the bud takes up more room. Then you don't have to buy as many stems. We are doing hydrangeas with a few roses here and there. Greenery is definitely the way to go to cut costs there as well! The size of the wedding party will also be a determining factor. We only have 4 bridesmaids and 4 groomsmen. Hope this helps! Let me know if you have more questions",
				"View Quoted Comment The venue includes full-day use of a bridal room (it's more like an apartment: fridge, kitchen, shower, etc.,), a room for the groom and his party, a venue coordinator and event coordinator who set up and tear down all the decorations, multiple fire pits with fire wood, servers for the wine (it's at a vineyard), and a 10% discount on all wine purchased for and leading up to the wedding (best wine in Maryland!). The ceremony starts after the winery closes, so we'll have access to the entire area. It's a lovely space! Yes, this is the caterer that I priced at $5k. We haven't set the menu yet and so we don't have an official price quote, but he stated that he won't exceed our set budget in his proposals, so it may be less than estimated. We don't necessarily want \"dance lighting\", as the venue already has really nice string lighting that matches the ambiance better. We're also not big dancers, but we do want to have fun. It would probably be best for us to get a DJ that doesn't do live mixing, as that will be more affordable. We're mostly going to hire the DJ for the personality and energy, not for their mixing skills. That's a great idea to ask around Church. We attend a relatively large church so I'm sure there's a good talent pool there. A lot of our friends from church are married, and we've asked them for recommendations, but they definitely had larger budgets than we do! I only have three in my party, and my fiance has two, so it's an intimate group.",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh my gosh, that is a fantastic deal for the venue! Definitely won't find anything like that for much cheaper! That is a wonderful package! I think that caterer is a good idea and that's wonderful that he will work with you! My florist was the same way! If you don't want lighting from your DJ or live mixing, then I think you can find a cheaper one than $2k. Were you planning on using them for your ceremony or just the reception? The intimate group will help with help with the price of flowers. Referrals and recommendations are the best way to go! You get the best deals that way sometimes!",
				"View Quoted Comment We'll need the DJ for both, as we need the sound equipment for the ceremony. They won't necessarily have to do anything during the ceremony except manage sound levels.",
				"View Quoted Comment About how many hours would you be using the DJ then? $1k may be a decent price if you're using them most of the day.",
				"View Quoted Comment It'd be 4pm - 11:30pm",
				"View Quoted Comment 6.5 hours is a good chunk of time. I think $1k is probably good to shoot for. But if you can find cheaper, that's always a plus!",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh man, I meant 7 - 11:30pm!",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh that's only 4.5 hours. I think for the kind of DJ you're looking for you might be able to find one that is a little cheaper than $1k.",

				"Good, I'm glad you're going to stay away from diet pills. They really aren't something you should get into since they aren't good for you. People who use them are a lot more likely to gain all the weight back once they stop taking them, too, which I'm sure is something you don't want.",

Try not to eat breads, sweets, potatoes, pasta, etc. Lean proteins, green veggies, lots of water.",

You can't just do 60 mins of cardio a day and expect to see amazing results. You need to work in weight lifting (no, you won't get buff, just toned). Weight training helps you burn more calories and it's best to exercise before eating since you'll burn those calories faster.You also need a good diet. You'll need a lot of protein to have the energy to workout and have the ability to lift more. I never cut out foods, just cut back. Just make sure you're eating enough to fuel your body.",

For example: if you are trying to lose 5-6% body fat and your deadline to lose it in a year from now, then I would suggest starting simple cardio and weight training routine 3 days a week for a month. Just to get your brain used to a new routine. Then add a day or two the month after. If your schedule permits it, do 30 minutes of cardio and 30 mins of weight training. Simple walking would help and split it throughout the day, this can help keep it less intimidating. Also, diet. Try to consume your carbs, fat, and protein in every meal. I wouldn't suggest eating more protein. Carbs provide energy not protein. Protein can actually cause weight gain and potentially dehydrate you without realizing it. And don't forget to eat your vegetables and fruits along with the recommended amount of fiber! =)",

I had a doctor put me on a low carb diet (not keto) and it was pretty calorie restrictive (3- 200 calorie meals, 2-3 - 100 calorie snacks) I did that for a while and lost a good 20 pounds quickly but it\u2019s no sustainable long term.

My husband made tacos ate them without a shell as a salad, burger without the bun. I made meatballs and spaghetti ate the spaghetti for dinner and just the leftover meatballs for lunch. I also try to have some left overs to bring for lunch so I\u2019m not eating frozen meals or lots of chips. Don\u2019t keep snack foods around. If they\u2019re there you\u2019ll eat them! Check potion sizes. They\u2019re usually much smaller than we think. And just more exercise and movement. My goal is to burn 500-600 calories a day. My Apple Watch tracks my calories burned from moving. My goal is set to 320 (i try to double it 3 times a week), that leaves me just under 300 to cut back with food. I aim to reach my goal everyday. In the week and a half I\u2019ve been at it, I\u2019ve lost my 2lbs. Now it could be water weight, not bloating from my cycle so I\u2019m trying to be too excited that it\u2019s coming off slowly.

				"Meal plans and track your macros. I use the myfitnesspal app (from under armour, it's free) and track what I eat everyday. You put all your info in there and it shows you how many calories you can eat and all that. Diet is a huge part of losing weight, you do not have to starve yourself or stop eating things you love, you just have to moderate and adjust certain things in and out (especially carbs)I definitely recommend going to the gym 3-4 times a week. Don't overwhelm yourself by going like everyday. Make a plan of what you're going to do before you get there. Ex: I work out Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat. I do legs on Monday, upper body on Wednesday, HIIT and abs on Friday and a full body workout on Saturday. I run each morning for about 10 mins to warm up and always remember to stretch. I been going for about a month and a half and lost about 10lbs. I am also doing a good amount of lifting and want to tone more than lose weight so my workouts reflect that. There are a lot of good accounts to follow on instagram too. I am no professional, but this is what I've been doing and I am seeing a lot of results. I feel better and I am finally feeling in shape for the first time since high school (10 years ago). Be kind to yourself and you'll get there.",

But everything someone suggests whether it\u2019s Keto, whole 30, no sugar, low carb etc it\u2019s all just a calorie deficit.

Im also comfortable without having solid abs. As long as my clothes fit me nicely and i feel good then im good. If you want the abs, biceps, and the whole nine then i suggest keto.

We each lost 15 lbs and my husband gained a lot of muscle weight during that time as well. For us, I've noticed using Instacart (grocery deliveries) works really well.

				"View Quoted Comment When I did WW I only signed up for the App (the 'digital' plan) with out the weigh ins so sometimes that's cheaper. Like I mentioned before, some companies offer fitness or health incentives/ reimbursements for these type of things (ex. mine will reimburse 50% of the cost once I prove I've logged for 10 weeks). Basically what I got was 100% access to the app, forums, etc. I didn't use the personal coaching, I think you have to go to weekly weigh ins and you need to see if that is offered anywhere near you because there are only certain places where those are held. The Just digital plan is significantly cheaper AND you can scan barcodes of food to quickly calculate.https://www.weightwatchers.com/checkout/plan?channelId=1&sponsorId=1&promotionId=1As far as BBG:https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/What-BBG-42201504https://www.sweat.com/pages/apphttps://www.sweat.com/The App is called SWEAT and the yearly fee is $119 from day of sign up. Check out those links for more info. The great thing about it, is you pick a trainer (depending on what kind of workouts you want to do) I switched from BBG (original workout app was based on) to FIERCE with a diff trainer. Then each week you get a new set of workouts. Its super interactive and you follow along with it. For example, the trainer shows you how to do each workout, there is a timer kept and you mark that you've completed the set. IT will keep time for breaks as well as listening to your own music through the app (your music will soften when the trainer speaks). I hope that helps with both. Let me know if you have any other questions. Also, I'm not sponsored for either, unfortunately, lol but I believe in both!",

I\u2019ve personally had a lot of success with intermittent fasting, and working out 3-4x/week with weight training thrown in. Been almost two months since I started and I\u2019ve lost 10 lbs. Intermittent fasting has helped not just on the diet/weight loss side, but my skin, sleep and overall energy level have benefited from it as well. Eating window is 12-8 PM and I\u2019m drinking water constantly, cutting out all soda and (mostly) alcohol (Zero app is awesome for tracking). Also, MyFitnessPal helps keep you in check with what you eat throughout the day. At home workouts have been great too (and free!).

I also drink a green superfood every day from amazing grass in a smoothie for breakfast. And I drink a cup of herbal tea before I go to bed. And I watch my salt and sugar intake. Doing this has helped me lose inches more then lose weight. Because I gain so much muscle. The snacks I bring are mix nuts, string cheese, fresh fruit and vegetables, and sometimes chia seed pudding.

I lost 20lbs in 6 months and it was helpful to see how many calories I was really eating. I also started going to the gym after work. Portion control + exercise will always lead to results in a healthy way because it is a lifestyle change. I was still able to eat all the food I wanted, I just had to alter how much I was eating. I also would aim to eat two 'healthier' meals and a 'normal' meal with portion control.The app has you enter your weight and your goal date, and that helps to configure how many calories per meal you are recommended to eat. Low card meal preps are life savers! Like others said, there are really good low calorie recipes online all the time Amazing meal for example <--- link if you like meat lol"

			"content": "Okay, so this may seem really pathetic but I seriously need help with losing weight. I have been religiously going to the gym since August of 2017, changing up the workouts, going in the mornings or going in the evenings during the week (depending when and if I get up in the mornings) or usually in morning or afternoon on weekends. But I have yet to find something that helps me consistently lose the weight. I juggle the same 20 pounds constantly. I do pretty good with watching what I eat for the most part but I still slip up and it's really upsetting and frustrating. I also have PCOS (Poly-cystic Ovarian Syndrome) and hypothyroidism which make it EXTREMELY difficult to lose weight. Does anyone have any tips for those health issues that I can basically walk over them and lose the weight any way? I've tried just about every fad diet you can think of so I don't want to do those. I just want a lifestyle change, a plan per say, that I can stick to. PLEASE HELP! I'm desperate.

				"Have you talked to their trainer? I go to a Planet Fitness in Illinois, and I felt like I was spinning my wheels until I got some advice from the trainer as far as what machines and order, etc. As far as the other issues go, I would suggest talking to a medical professional about your eating - I wish I had better advice, but those medical issues definitely need more help than I can give you . . . I will say - whether you lose the weight or not, you are going to be a beautiful bride.",
				"Weight loss is mostly diet. With your medical conditions, I would highly suggest keto as it will actually help with those as well.And, like I always used to tell my clients, \"when you have a goal to meet, it's way more important to put the work in on the days you don't feel like it the most.\"",

Losing weight for the wedding wont work as much as you want it to. You already have health issues and giving yourself a deadline just adds stress which will be even more harmful to your body. You might end up depressed or angry with yourself over things you can\u2019t control due to your medical issues. Set your goal to be healthy for your future. Forget the scale and the tape measure. Focus on good results like low cholesterol. Second, your fianc\u00e9 loves you already. Right now. Today. No matter what that scale says. I guarantee when you are walking down the aisle towards your love, the smile on your face and the love in your eyes will make you the most beautiful bride in the world.",

We also share a name, and I live in Canton Michigan \ud83d\ude0a",
				"I dont know anything about your diet or exercise regimen but I can offer some advice. First, exercise is just as important as your diet. Without keeping tour metabolism high, you will need to eat fewer and fewer calories to maintain any weight loss. Losing 20 lba is great! But you now are expending that much less energy carrying 20lbs less around so your body needs less calories. To combat this, you really need at least 30 mins of cardio every day. Additionally, weight training will help boost your metabolism and make you look awesome. So incorporate both regularly. And many will say that a brisk walk is enuf. Its not. You should really be challenging yourself on both cardio (intensity, duration or both) and strength training. Secondly, eat like you are training and not dieting. That means watch your calories but eat foods that provide your body with real nutrients it can use...protein, fat, and carbs. 200 cals of fatty chips does not equal 200 cals of lean protein to your body. A cal is not just a cal. Lastly, as you mentioned, think of this as a lifestyle rather than just losing wt for the wedding. Always strive for progress, not perfection. Measure you against you and not others. See how far you have come and where you want to go. And if you do slip up occasionally, make it brief and get right back to it. Be happy with your efforts.\ud83d\ude0a",

				"I mean, what do you honestly think is getting in the way? And then try to approach it that way. I know for me that for a while I was having a soda once a day, because I had a taste for it and it was there. My fiance and I gave the soda away and we switched to plain old soda water and surprisingly it does what I need it to do when a craving strikes. I also have a snack problem \ud83e\udd23 so I only have healthy snacks in the house which i think will be a good sub for what I'm craving, e.g. roasted spicy chickpeas as a sub for chips (because I love salty, crunchy stuff). Workout motivation wise, I now focus on weightlifting as opposed to a bunch of cardio that really was just hurting my knees. But everyone's different. I think that you should write down a list of what's getting in the way (the big and the small) and try to tackle a little bit at a time. Good luck!! \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Fad diets don\u2019t work for the long run. That\u2019s why they\u2019re fads (only for the moment). The way to lose weight is to take in fewer calories, drink water and exercise. Because of that, I always recommend Weight Watchers. It\u2019s real world eating, but you learn proper portions and healthier options. Most of all, it works and it\u2019s easy. IDK how much you desire to lose. But in 8 months you could easily lose 50 pounds.",
				"Diet is definitely the main factor for weight loss, combined with exercise. I would talk to your doctor since you have a medical condition and see what they say. You can talk to your trainer about the weight limit to use; remember for weight loss, it\u2019s usually low weight, high reps. That could be why they gave you that number. If you\u2019re stronger than that, see if they advise you to add more, but generally people trying to bulk do high weight. The only time I was ever able to lose a good amount of weight I was logging calories daily and working out 3-4 times a week. Keeping a food log, although tedious, can actually be really helpful and keep you more aware of what you\u2019re actually consuming. Also remember you\u2019re beautiful as you are! I am in the same boat, though, so I get it! Getting married is my motivation to get healthier. Good luck!",
				"I can relate to your concerns too! Many pp have given excellent advice. My only advice is if you change your diet to something with less sugar and carbs have your blood tested again to check your TSH levels. I am currently on the modified Low carb lifestyle and had the sluggish system too but it turned out my TSH levels changed and called for a lower dosage of medicine. Eventually I no longer needed the meds and feel great. But it took years to figure out what was going on with my body and made the changes just so I could feel good again. Thyroid issues are scary and when I tried harder in the gym it raised my cortisol levels and my adrenals were keeping me from losing anything. I listened to my doctor and started doing yoga and re-centered myself. For me pushing myself harder didn\u2019t help. It did the opposite. But after I got my hormones back in check I can go strong again. I am not skinny by all means, but I love me like this. I hope you get there too! Don\u2019t give up! Good luck on your journey!!",

Bonus for me besides remission of my chronic illness is that I'm the leanest I've been in the past 16 years. Yoga is toning me up. If you want to get healthier, you just need to figure out the lifestyle choices that are best for you. It's a sometimes challenging journey that is so totally worth it at the end.

				"Hi, I lost 50 lbs a few years ago (170-120) and I have found the easiest way to do it is through simple math: Decide how many pounds you want to lose and multiply that by 3,500 calories (how many calories are in one pound of fat). Then decide that by how much time you have until your wedding. So, for example if you want to lose 20lbs in 6 months you need to burn 70,000 calories in total by then or 2,916 a week, or 416 a day (just divided them). Then calculate your activity through a Basil Metabolic Rate (how much you burn if you were in a coma state doing nothing...there\u2019s online calculators for it). So for me, my BMR was 1600 and I did around 400 calories of extra exercise (like walking around and stuff...I didn\u2019t really go to the gym). If you want to get really technical you can wear a Fitbit which will tell you exactly how much you burn daily (be careful those can get obsessive tho!)So based off this and our example, if you burned 2100 calories a day and ate 1500 calories a day you\u2019d lose 20lbs by the 6month mark. And eating 1500 calories is really easy...barely any dieting! If you go to the gym you can eat even more!This is just what worked for me, hope it helps you! If you decide to do this for yourself make sure to do the numbers based on your weight and timeline, you can message me if you want me to do it for you lol. There are so many other ways to lose weight too! This was just the most straight forward way that gave me scientific assurance I would lose!",
				"Have you tried Keto? My fience and I have been on it for 3 weeks now and it\u2019s pretty great. It\u2019s an adjustment. But it\u2019s not too bad. And there are so many options to really have the lifestyle change work for you and keep you on track.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yes I have talked with my doctor and they said I have been doing everything right and they just think I'm not able to lose the weight because my body won't allow it. I don't drink soda hardly ever.",
				"View Quoted Comment Lower weight and more reps sometimes has a better effect than heavy weight. You tend to develop leaner muscle than bulky muscle with lower weight.",

				"View Quoted Comment This. I've read many things about keto being helpful for the medical issues you're facing. Good luck!",

				"You could try intermittent fasting. That is what I am doing right now.",
				"Since you have medical conditions, I recommend going to a nutritionist or a professional dietician with experience in helping people that have medical issues.",
				"I have PCOS and hypothyroidism that we can never keep regulated with medication so my levels are always ridiculously high. I saw a nutritionist to get some help. She has me eating 30-45 grams of carbs at each meal (3 per day) and protein with every meal. Also I had to eat 2-3 snacks per day of 15-25 carbs. I am down 85lbs so far in 2 years with about 50 more to go. I had tried every fad diet, weight loss program, pills, vitamins, shakes whatever was on the market...nothing worked. Just cutting out most of my soda and drinking more water and eating regularly it helped me lose the weight and keep it off. I don't work out much, just my normal day to day walking at work and such and I'm still losing.",
				"What you put in your body makes much more of a difference than working out. The meal plan i used (and lost 60lbs in about 9 months!) Was high protein, moderate carbs, and low fat. It can be boring but it got the job done!",
				"There are some good tips mentioned, and yes, it may be better to speak with a Registered Dietitian who specializes in PCOS. Another thought is to ask you healthcare professional, or a Dietitian about CoQ10. There is some research on it for PCOS support.",

I do Lagree three times a week for strength and toning, but the weight loss part really happened when I added in cardio with the Peloton and making a conscious decision to eat healthier lunches (I workout 6x a week total, 6 times on Peloton with a 30-45 minute minimum workout each day I workout). For dinner, I just watch my portions but will pretty much eat whatever. I never eat breakfast except on Sundays, so for lunch, I stopped ordering in and started eating only salads with grilled chicken and 60-90 calorie dressing (Ken\u2019s lite Caesar or Organic Girl white cheddar ranch style).

				"View Quoted Comment That's fantastic! Do you feel hungry all the time??",
				"If you are working out a lot you may not be eating enough food. 1200 calories isn't a lot of food, even for trying to lose weight. Take how much you weigh and multiple it by 15 to see how many calories you should be eating. Then you only want to cut 20% of that. Or you will \"starve\" your body and it won't lose weight as effectively. Now keto is a whole other thing. My FH list 15 pounds in less than a month on it. I just started yesterday and I am going strong. We are super strict though, no cheese, dairy, sugars and less than 10 carbs a day. I am hoping to lose 30 pounds by the end of June. Fingers crossed",

The key is to up your protein and lower your carbs...there are certain calculations to find out where you should be in the calorie range..like me I am up in the 2300 range a day and the inches are dropping so hopefully I will be where I would love to be by my wedding! You have to remember and what was so hard for me for years is that 85% of weight loss is in your nutrition and it sucks! haha ... good luck!",
				"That's really rude of your customer to say that. I don't care if someone is obviously pregnant, you never mention anything. You could absolutely lose the weight!If you want to lose weight FAST, try the Scarsdale diet. It's pretty lean (800-1200 calories a day) but you do it for 2 weeks and you drop pounds fast. Combine that with working out a little harder and you're going to lose the weight.",

				"View Quoted Comment Thanks for the advice! I'll look into that more!",
				"Yes, this last year has been really hard for me as my metabolism has pretty much just ghosted me now that I am older. I am on weight watchers and doing barre for an hour 5 to 6 days a week.

And you should be eating 5-6 times a day..and yes thru beachbody they are..the most popular programs are 21 day fix (I recommend to start out) 21 day fix extreme and 80 day obsession...each have their own calorie calculations based on the intensity of the workouts to make sure you are fueling your body correctly.",
				"View Quoted Comment You're welcome and good luck!",
				"It's really rude to say such things to women. I've been losing weight recently, and now it seems that exercising with Zumba video is very effective.

				"This is why I just purchased my first Spanx... desperate times call for desperate measures.",
				"Check with your doctor. That's always the first thing I suggest. Also, drink a lot more water than you think you need. If you're dehydrated, your body holds the water weight more stubbornly. Get lots of sleep because the right amount of sleep allows your body to work more optimally and you will get more out of your workouts. Get your heart rate up at least three times a week, more if you can handle it. Make permanent dietary changes, because let me tell you from experience - if you start a diet and use it to lose weight for a specific event and then go back to eating the way you were before - ALL the weight will come back plus some. It was a terrible lesson to learn and made me feel terrible. And if you do everything you can and still can't take off the weight, Spanx. Good luck, and I hope you feel beautiful on your wedding day!",
				"View Quoted Comment I too join weight watchers in January 2016. Due to having poor health and being heavy.

Two years later I\u2019ve lost a total of 102 pounds. And still eating healthy. That\u2019s really our main goal is to be healthy. Good luck on what ever you start with but always remember you can do it.",

I'm kind of restricting calories, but I'm just trying to eat healthier in general.I've been going to the gym but not nearly as often as I should, and my weight is completely fluctuating.I'm a bit overweight for my height, so I want to lose 10 pounds by the wedding, but as days tick by I'm getting nervous it won't happen.Guess I just need to suck it up and quit having too many cheat days!!!! And go to the gym more often!",
				"Cut carbs. No pasta, bread, corn, potatoes, sugars etc. Also no soy products because it can cause inflammation. I lost 50lbs in 6 months doing low carb/keto diet. And I\u2019ve been eating that way for many years since I started.",
				"My advice is to not do a diet - you limit yourself to certain foods or calorie limits and since a diet is usually temporary that means the weight you lost, if you lost any, will just come back when you stop dieting. Eating healthier does help, but losing weight is all about finding a balance between what you eat, drink, and do. If you're doing two or those three things, but not the other, you're only going to see so much progress.I started a desk job in last September, highly sedentary work compared to my prior activity of crossing a university campus on an almost daily basis by foot. I gained almost 10 pounds, and back when I started I was already 15 pounds heavier than I wanted to be. So now, 25 pounds to lose. I wasn't happy with how I felt, and I knew my dress was definitely not going to fit me if I didn't lose some weight (my wedding is October of this year). I started making small changes in my eating habits - making it a point to eat a balanced breakfast, snack on healthy foods throughout the day, and eat smaller meals for lunch and dinner as opposed to huge ones. Cooking your own food rather than eating out also helps. In addition, I cut back on sugary drinks like pop and, yes, even my coffee. I used to hate exercising, but I've also always felt so fatigued and lacking in energy... I picked up exercising on a regular basis 3-5x a week, and I feel much better, have more energy to do things, and sleep much better. It also helps to have a buddy who will do these things with you, it will keep you accountable. They don't have to be glued to your side, but be supportive or what you're trying to do for yourself.TL;DR: Balance what you eat, drink, and do. If one doesn't match the work you're doing with the others then you may want to step it up. Dieting and cutting calories isn't always the best. Have a buddy to help support you and hold you accountable. Start with small steps and gradually increase, especially with exercise.",
				"Balancing everything I eat, drink, and do over the past few weeks has helped me lose 5lbs so far. If you want to lose the weight, you can do it!",
				"View Quoted Comment If I am needing to switch things up I will look up keto recipes. Biggest thing for keto is that you don't eat carbs, like bread, fruit, or anything with a lot of sugar. You need to keep carbs below 30g a day for weight loss. So as long as you do that you can eat pretty much whatever.",
				"For me, I can't seem to lose any weight unless I'm going so hardcore that I'm drenched in sweat. Weight resistance training is super unhelpful as it makes my weight peek up as much as five pounds after two weeks. It's definitely frustrating, but try to remember that all bodies are different, and you might just need to try switching up how you exercise/what activities you're doing. I have the best success with hiking and bike riding (so cardio, I guess).You can do this, just put your mind to it and think positive thoughts",
				"Count me in keto camp. I wasn't sure about it, to be honest. I have several friends and family members that have followed it successfully for a while so I thought I'd give it a shot. When following strictly, it does drop weight fast. I lost 5lbs in the first week. Obviously water weight, and not a sustainable ratio of loss:time, but it is effective and will level off to a more \"normal\" rate of loss over time. It really is more of a lifestyle than a diet, and as with anything should be combined with lots and lots of water and a reasonable amount of exercise. Whether you decide to do keto or just practice more healthful living, I would definitely recommend My Fitness Pal and logging everything you eat - and I do mean EVERYTHING. It really helps to hold yourself accountable and say \"yeah... I don't need that snack...\" Though I would encourage anyone, no matter your eating habits, to not forget to indulge yourself once in a while either.",
				"View Quoted Comment I've been super curious about the keto diet. I keep trying to research but I refuse to pay for the starter kit if it doesn't work. Any advice or recipes you like?",
				"What worked for me is no carbs, sugar or dairy. Lean protein, veggies, some fruit. Lots of water. 30 minutes of exercise 5 times a week.",
				"View Quoted Comment Starter kit?? I don't know anything about this. But just googling keto and keto recipes on pinterest was helpful to me. Also, there is a reddit subform that has lots and lots of info - maybe even too much. But you shouldn't have to pay for or buy any kind of \"starter kit\" - that's just going to be a ripoff. The short of it is high fat / no(low) carb and moderate protein.",
				"Rachel, here are 3 apps to help you get started. I have never paid for a starter kit and been doing keto for 2 years. Always use the free portions of apps or research on Google for free info. The top 2 apps are awesome, great info and tell you how to start off. Bottom one I only recently found and haven't looked at much. Check them out and feel free to ask me any questions you have",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you so much!!!",
				"Also, this: https://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/",
				"Use the my fitness pal app. I was restricting my calories to 1,200 a day but realized I wasn't losing weight. I actually had to up my calories to 1,560 a day so my body would burn more calories. Eat a ton of veggies, and limit carbs (bread, taco shells, pasta). Try cauliflower rice as an alternative to rice and use lettuce as a substitute for a shell or bun. Also drink lots of water!",
				"I'm in this boat right now, when my dress came in I tried it on at the store and it was TIGHT! I'm hoping to lose weight by August when I'm getting alterations done.",
				"Careful with restrictive \"lifestyles\" like keto or whole30. We actually do the whole30 pretty frequently but I know of plenty of people who have tried both and lost a ton of weight and then went right back to eating the way they were before and gained all the weight back really fast and then some. When we aren't doing a whole30 round we are 90% compliant as in we don't do sugar unless it's a special occasion like a birthday and then if we do then we do a strict 2 weeks to not get off course and let sugar dominate again.",
				"Don't eat less than 1500 calories a day or your body may go into ketosis or starvation mode and either burn muscle (not fat) or fail to dump weight at all. This was one of the hardest things I had to learn when dieting because it seems intuitive that the less you eat the more then lose--intuitive, but wrong. Best of luck!",
				"1200 calories seems a little low in my opinion. Depending on your height and current weight, you may want to recalculate your daily calories because your body could decide to conserve what fat it has because it's worried of starvation. I know it's tempting, but just be careful.I am 5'3\", and originally weighed about 133 lbs when I started my weight loss goal 2 years ago. It took dedication, will power, and being very consistent with my food, working out habits, and choices but I am now 114-115 lbs. I noticed the best results when I paired running intervals (run 4 minutes at 7 mph, run 4 minutes at 6 mph) for 25 minutes and then finishing it up with a weight workout. I ate about 1300 calories and used FitBit to track exercise, goals, and to log meals. I used MyFitnessPal to figure out how many calories food that I cooked would equate to (and weighed food by oz or g). I also have an Aria 2 via FitBit to track weight and body fat percentage. It may seem a little crazy, but I really wanted to create better eating habits and to do that I felt like I needed to monitor, watch, and understand how my body reacted to food. For example, pizza causes severe bloating due to the amount of sodium and I can gain 2-3 lbs more than my average weight and have it stick for days until I can work it through.I normally eat:Breakfast: 2 hard boiled eggs 140 calLunch: Homemade Nourish Bowl (inspired by Mann's Nourish Bowls) 300 cal & mandarin orange 40-50 calSnack: Lite string cheese 50 calSnack 2: Yoplait Yogurt 100 calDinner: Veggie & Meat mixture with brown rice, or veggie pasta 350ish calSnack 3: Banana 100 cal with 1-2 tbsp Natural Creamy Peanut Butter 95-190 (abt 290 cal)Total: 1280 cal*I aim lower so I have room to potentially munch on something else in between snacks or meals, or I add a little more brown rice or pasta to my food later in the evening. I find ways to get it to 1300 by adding cocoa nibs to my banana at the end of the day, or sprinkling a little sugar on the peanut butter.It takes consistency, and it also takes the will power to know when to take a rest day so your body can repair and rest from the workouts. It also means working out when your body feels sore, and being a little more antisocial by avoiding get-togethers at restaurants and cutting alcohol and other sugar drinks completely.Hope this helped..."

I had to take some pain killers in the limo on the way to the reception from the church to stave off a cramp but honestly I think the adrenaline from the day itself kept me going and kept the blah period feelings away. I had worn my modibodi period panties anyway because I knew there was a chance it could start so I didn't have to worry about changing pads or tampons or anything.Moral of the story: You can try the advice given by other people but it's also not the end of the world if your period does start on your wedding day.",

				"This is my biggest fear because I can't move if I'm on my period. I'm literally bed ridden for the first two or three days. Even my birth control pill doesn't hold it back. I'm praying when the day comes, I just finished bleeding. Just prepare yourself as much as possible for it, or ask your doctor/gyno about skipping or making it come earlier (which all I have to do is skip 2 pills and I'm bleeding sooo) But I say your doc will be your best friend for this scenario."

				"I'm not a doctor, but I do get hives too from various soaps, detergents, cosmetics, lotions, touching literally anything... You should take an antihistamine, like Benadryl. It reduces the hives and relives the itching. If you can stay home for a day, I recommend it. Benadryl makes me so sleepy.Also take an oatmeal Aveeno bath or a bath with baking soda. Make sure the water is on the cooler side -- not cold, but you don't want it hot. After the bath, take a washrag and soak it in cold water and use it as a compress on the most hive-y parts of your skin. Wear loose, baggy cotton clothing. Try to keep as cool as possible. Calamine lotion helps with the itching.If you're still not clearing up in a few days, see a doctor. If you think you've used anything new (soaps, lotions, etc.) or eaten anything new in the past few days, stop using or eating that immediately until you can 100% identify the cause of the hives. It might be that new detergent, but if you used anything else new recently it could be that too.",

				"Okay I just had a consultation with an esthetician & a dermatologist this morning - hopefully I can share some tips that will help! Keep in mind, they gave me a lot of products to help too so if these simple tips don\u2019t help, it may be helpful to consult a professional. 1. Get rid of fabric softeners/dryer sheets. Fabric softeners coat the cotton fibers in your clothing and will clog your pores causing acne, this is especially helpful for backne because your whole back is exposed to your clothes. 2. Drink PLENTY of water, take your weight in Lbs, divide by 2, and that\u2019s how many ounces of water you need to be drinking. Acne is caused by access oils (and other things) buy you need to hydrate to flush those oils off your skin 3. Don\u2019t pick. Whatever you do and however tempting it is to grab a really tough loofah and scrub the crap out of it. Don\u2019t. you will irritate your skin, and could possibly make the acne worse. And this can result in hyperpigmentation. Which would be worse than acne because now you have dark spots all over your back! 4. Get rid of scented soaps! Soaps with fragrance and dye are no good for your skin, especially acne prone. Hope this helps!!!",
				"Thanks Stephanie!! And you know\u2014I\u2019ve actually been overdoing it on the fabric softener. That\u2019s a really different tip and I appreciate you sharing the wealth!",
				"Tea tree oil is good for acne in general. It\u2019s clean and natural, won\u2019t strip your natural oils. They make tea tree body wash, my favorite brand is Jason. It keeps my gross body acne at bay from going to the gym. Sweaty gym clothes causes breakouts like crazy!!",
				"I used the proactive body wash before both mine and my brother's weddings - worked like a charm",
				"I would go to a dermatologist for sure, it's good to develop an overall skin, hair, nails plan now for the next year (even if you are happy with skin/hair/nails, there is always room for improvement and better to be healthy and happy than stressed as the wedding gets closer). I would switch to a gentle cleansing body wash in the mean time, and make sure to shower at least once a day but also quickly after anything that causes you to sweat (working out, gardening, super hot outside, etc.) so the sweat doesn't just sit on your back. Also shower after you put lotion on your back (massage or whatever) so it doesn't clog up pores. Buying a back brush or body scrubber is great too, it will help exfoliate your back. Wear cotton, breathable clothing. Drink lots of water. Wash pajamas, towels & sheets regularly.",
				"This could be a hormonal imbalance. i live by these supplements called Balance by Alani Nu. It clears up acne (all kinds) and regulates your hormones in your body. It was a saving grace for me!",
				"Hey there! I\u2019ve actually started having the same issue starting a few weeks before I actually got engaged up until now. My back has significantly cleaned up a lot since I\u2019ve been forcing myself to drink water. I was freaking out because when I had went dress shopping I was worried because my dress is pretty much backless and I didn\u2019t want to feel self conscious on my wedding day. Water is the answer. If it doesn\u2019t clear up after a week or so then I would definitely see a dermatologist! Good luck \ud83d\ude18",

				"Panoxy and bio oil worked wonders on my back",
				"My dermatologist suggested using a salicylic acid scrub (doesn't matter the concentration) on my back and chest (NOT on my face!!). It can be a bit drying, so my skin sometimes feels taut, but I haven't had any acne there since!! I would NEVER use the stuff on my face though... I did once on accident and it burned like crazy.",

They ordered it in the size I am now..which is honestly the largest I've been in a very long time..and I was planning on losing weight. However, the one I got takes months to get in. They almost weren't able to get it for me but the manager was there to check with the supplier. It wasn't recommended that I order smaller in case I don't lose. Anyway, I'm scared to lose weight now. The beading on the bodice is intricate and I don't know how good it would look if it had to be taken in. What if I lose too much and need a new dress? This one was at the very top of my budget and would take too long to get the same one in..Any storied or advice is appreciated.",

				"It's a gorgeous dress, and I know you will look beautiful in it no matter what weight you are! However, I can completely understand wanting to lose some weight so that you do feel more confident on your big day. How much are you planning on losing? I was kind of in a similar situation where I ordered the size I was at the time and ended up losing 10 lbs in between alterations, so they had to take it in a full size and a half. If you only plan on losing 10-15 lbs, your seamstress should still be able to work with that. I definitely agree with @Samantha though - consult with your seamstress prior to the weightless to ensure she can accommodate it in her alterations. Good luck!",
				"View Quoted Comment I haven't talked to them about it yet. I guess that would be the first step! The appointment was very stressful and overwhelming towards the end. A lot was going on.

				"View Quoted Comment I don't know how much I'm planning on losing now that I have a dress. I wanted to lose a lot before I found one..but the dresses I looked at and loved can take about 6-8 months to come in and I don't even have that much time. I'm currently 5'2\" and 190lbs. I was 200lbs two weeks before my dress appointment. I want to be healthy for my height. Eventually I would like to be around 130-150..depending on how that looks on me now that I'm in my thirties and have had a child. (I had her eight years ago..so it's not new weight.) I was 155 a few years back and that was okay. I was about 2-3 sizes smaller at that weight.",

				"I don't have any advice except to say that I have struggled with that same fear! My dress has an illusion top with lace, front & back, so not even much of a true \"bodice\". I posted on here a while ago worried about what if I lost weight and it couldn't be altered OR what if it was too expensive, etc.... and someone on here replied that your health is worth the cost! I've thought about that a lot since then. I want to be healthy, period. Every garment of clothing (I sew a little bit) can be worked on. So I'm going to trust that and find a good seamstress.",

I\u2019m sure to dry it really well. I apply lotion constantly. Nothing seems to help. I even asked the people at the jewelry store where FH bought my ring and they had never heard of that happening. The ring is definitely real white gold, so no allergy issues.What the heck is going on and more importantly, how do I make it stop?",
			"comments": [
				"This is a picture of my ring finger. You can see how irritated it is. Sorry you have to look at my gross finger!",

				"Does the ring move around a lot?",
				"Hmm, maybe when you go to bed at night you take off the ring when you sleep or when you get home?",
				"You might try taking off the ring before showering or washing your hands, and then drying your hands carefully before putting the ring back on. Moisture under the ring can cause irritation like you described.",
				"I agree it is from the moisture between ring and skin. The same thing happens to me. It gets dry and flaky. I dont have any issue when I wear my silicone ring but that is breathable",
				"Maybe trade off every few days between your ring and a silicone ring. It might help it breathe better. Sometimes soap gets stuck in between and can dry skin out. I worked at a hospital for a while so I know that feeling all too well when you\u2019re constantly washing and it gets dry. i know that\u2019s probably not what you want to hear I hate taking my ring off, but I do like Enso silicone rings they have pretty stuff! Good luck! Hope this helps \ud83d\ude0a",

				"You should try removing your ring once you\u2019re home to have it on less time. I would remove it every time you wash your hands and make sure is very dry before you put it on again. I would also change the soap and lotion. My husband has a similar issue but only with his work ring which is not white gold is like a rubber silicone material. He only gets this when he showers with it because the bottom of the ring gets wet and stays wet so the skin gets crack. He doesn\u2019t have that issue with the white gold.",
				"White gold can be composed of different percentages of different metals, but it typically contains nickel, which many people are allergic to. It could be that there is more nickel in the ring and you are reacting to that. You could take it to a jeweler and have the inside of the ring coated or replated so your skin isn't in contact with the nickle.",
				"I do not have this problem myself so I do not know if this is right but I do know my skin is very sensitive. Sometimes your skin can build up of bacteria under your ring and since you say it isn't the material then you should try washing your ring every month in jewelery Polish, not only will that help the bacteria but it will help the shine of your ring stay perfect. The build up of lotion can effect that too. I found a website on cracking of the skin but I can't seem to get it to zoom in but my phone is terrible so you might can try. https://books.google.com/books?id=odQ_AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA518&lpg=PA518&dq=is+skin+cracking+where+your+ring+is+normal?&source=bl&ots=AvvaEDxKpe&sig=ACfU3U2rj7qt1t6LZ6HAAOakCiOeVWeHzA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBlKXF2oHkAhVmiOAKHZTIArgQ6AEwGXoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=is%20skin%20cracking%20where%20your%20ring%20is%20normal%3F&f=false",

White gold is a mixture of yellow gold, then white metals such as nickel, silver and palladium to turn it white. You could be allergic to the nickel in the metal or even the rhodium plating.Sorry about your finger! It looks painful. \ud83d\ude30",

My weight hasn't fluctuated since when I was very young, so this change was surprising and disheartening when I realized none of my clothes fit anymore. My FW had the opposite experience and gained weight, so while it is an interesting conversation, I would recommend getting your stressed out emotions off your chest. You don't need to mention weight to talk about stress/anxiety.My suggestion would be to treat yourself as much as possible these next few weeks. Bubble baths, aromatherapy, naps, and tons of good, protein-rich food. Otherwise, consider using a padded bra if you want it, and just focus on looking confident and feeling beautiful the day of!

The world should fade away once you get down the aisle, and if it doesn't, look in the eyes of the people who can emotionally hold you up. You keep focused on those people until you can get control of your breath. Focus on why you are there, it is a happy moment. Are you familiar with your officiant?

That\u2019s good.. so focus on the butterflies in your tummy and move into gratitude by listing all the things in grateful for. That helps me through anxiety a lot. I sometimes confuse anxiety, fear, excitement, anticipation, and pure joy... they feel very similar sometimes. also try some breathing exercises.

I'd just continue to use a good skincare routine (cleanser, toner, serum, lotion), always take your makeup off every night, wash your pillowcase & sheets every 3-5 days, and avoid touching your face (like normal). Depending on your type of acne, I'd avoid sugary or fatty food right before the wedding too. If you are still concerned in a week, I'd contact the salon that did the facial and express your concerns.",

				"Completely and totally normal. Your skin is now in an angry purging phase because the facial opened up the flow that\u2019s supposed to happen from the oil produced by your subaceous glands to the surface of your skin. So if you had blockages and everyone gets them, along with that comes bacteria that gets trapped in there with toxins that build up.You can help the healing process by gently using warm conpresses to open up your pores. Use tea tree oil as a disinfectant, then use very gentle cleanser like CeraVe to help was away extra debris. Just make sure you use a cold toner to close everything up again\u2014witch hazel is great\u2014keep it i your fridge, it will be more soothing.

			"content": "Hey ladies! Soooo, I'm so sad. And I need to vent. Turns out I completely tore my acl at my bachelorette party riding a mechanical bull (good story at least). I had a frieken blast & it was the end of the night, thank god! But... Now I have to have reconstructive surgery on my knee and I'm out of work for at least 6 weeks or more. I go to the dr tomorrow to discuss my options but I am just so sad and worried I won't be recovered in time for my wedding. Let alone stressed out with all the wedding bills coming in now and being out of work :/ has anyone here ever had this type of surgery? I would appreciate any advice! I'm just heartbroken over it all. Thanks ladies!",
			"comments": [
				"Holy crap! my mom tore her ACL and i cant remember an exact time line so ask your doctor but i kind of think that you maybe in a knee brace at your wedding but you might be able to walk down the aisle. ask the doctor.",
				"Thanks surfer girl! I know, it's brutal. I'm definitely asking him tomorrow I was just trying to prepare myself. I'll be so sad if I have to wear this ugly brace under my dress :/ as long as I can walk and dance I'll be happy-ish",
				"Best of luck! i hope the appointment goes well, if you look online you can find rough estimates for healing time. I found roughly 4-8 weeks. of course it all depends on your case.",
				"Thanks so much! Yeah I looked it up but it really varies per case. My dr said my acl is completely gone. I need a graph from either my own body or a cadaver... Which freaks me out. I just thought I'd throw it out there to see if anyone knew anything about it from experience. Trying to ease my mind. Thanks for the well wishes I appreciate it!! I think we'll have to at least postpone our honeymoon",
				"I'm so sorry; that sounds very painful I hope you get better soon!!",
				"Aww thanks so much Courtney! Just hoping to be okay for the wedding!",
				"Lauren my mom had to have a tendon from a cadaver to repair hers too so it was pretty bad. (idk why i felt the need to share that lol) she had to wear the brace for a while but wasn't on crutches terribly long.",
				"Do you get short-term disability through your work? That might help with the bills and being out of work.",
				"Thanks surfer girl! Yeah I think the cadaver donation would be a quicker healing time I just have to get passed the idea of it :/ I appreciate you sharing that's very helpful!! Sarah I'm actually a self employed nanny so I don't get any of that. They are looking to hire someone else in the mean time. I'm so upset I love those kids. At least one is a flower girl in my wedding!",
				"My Dh had a torn ACL, not as bad as yours sounds though. He has also had 3 surgeries and is missing his meniscus in one knee. I know that the recovery wasn't fun (what recovery is?) but I believe he was up and walking pretty quick with the ACL one, just with a brace and it was hard. =/ condolences for you, but I think 2 months away, you should hopefully be ok!",
				"Ahh you gave me hope, thank you Mrs Gee!!!",
				"You're welcome! its hard it all depends on the person and the surgery unfortunately! Don't skip on PT though! I had a meniscal tear and I was running 2 weeks later. I think I did ok because I was motivated to get up and tired of any pain, I am allergic to pain meds so I did anything post op without meds. However I never did PT and in November before our wedding, I twisted it and I think I have torn whatever they fixed =/ My fault though! Hang in there and do what the doc says, they know their stuff.. I apparently thought PT was a joke and skipped it, I now have to go in again lol I think you'll be ok though, and I know itll be tough away from work because you love your job! But you can catch up on tv, relax, wedding plan and spend more time in WW!",
				"You are so sweet mrs gee! Really lifted my spirits, I needed that. Thank you so much! I def won't be skipping out on PT!",
				"I have no useful advice about torn ACL but I hope you have a speedy recovery!",
				"Thank you so much miss NC!",
				"Good lord Lauren!! Hoping for a speedy recovery for you I have purposely taken a TEN week hiatus from horseback riding so that something like this didn't happen to me. I would have never thought you'd get that injured riding a mechanical bull! Like you said, good thing you had a blast doing it & it really is a good story good luck",
				"I am not a doctor nor do I have any experience with this type of injury so I can't be of much help on that end. However I would advise you to completely follow orders with whatever amount of rest they recommend! Your wedding isn't very far away, so I know it will be tempting to over-do things while trying to tie up all the loose ends. I think if you don't flare up the injury you will be fine by October. Best wishes to you for a speedy recovery!!!",
				"Thank you so much! Ahh yeah your smart for making that decision! I was SO excited to ride that thing too I insisted on going after the game, who would have known all this would happen... Hoping to look back and laugh at it all... just glad we decided on an earlier bachelorette party! Thank you so much for your well wishes!",
				"I agree Brittany, thanks for that reminder! I'm very stubborn/independent and have been planning my wedding for a year and a half now. I just hope it's everything I wanted it to be. There's still so much to do it's driving me crazy! FH has been amazing through it all along with my family and BMs. Got a long road a head but through sickness and health right? thank you! You ladies are making me feel a lot better.",
				"I tore my ACL and meniscus in high school and had the repair with the cadaver tendon. It was pretty sucky. The brace you have to wear keeps your leg COMPLETELY straight and that's a pain in the ass. Then you slowly get angles... 15 degrees, 30 degrees, etc lol. The physical therapy was annoying (2x per week) but it wasn't super painful. I remember when I first got out of surgery my entire leg was covered in bruises and I had to take pain medicine for two weeks, but after that I don't remember it hurting much at all. Are you getting it done laparoscopically? I did, so I only have 3 small entry hole scars, and one two-inch scar so that part is good. Oh, but I did lose a lot of the feeling around my knee due to nerve damage, but I heard that doesn't happen to everyone. Good luck, it's a frustrating process but you'll get through it. Make sure you have a lot of movies on hand... it's hard to get around with the full leg brace!",
				"FH had his repaired in November. He had to be in a brace for 6 months. He was in PT for a month. His was torn for 2 years prior to repair. You may ask about the option of waiting until after the wedding?",
				"At least you have a good story! My only advice is if you're going to be on crutches for more than a week or two, look into ergonomic crutches. I got them on Amazon when I had hip surgery and they make it so much more comfortable. They absorb the shock, don't hurt your armpits, and fold up when not in use. Wishing you a speedy recovery!",
				"I'm a little late to comment but just wanted to send some well wishes and advice! I had ACL repair surgery in 2008 and it was rough but not horrible. Obviously follow what your doctor advises, but because of scheduling it was about a month between my tear and surgery so maybe you can delay the surgery until after the wedding? I was in a full leg brace that whole time but had it loosened to allow for full bending after about a week or so. You don't need an ACL to live (but do if you plan to lead an active life without pain or discomfort), so the brace is there more for comfort and to hold everything in place so there's no more damage. It sounds like I had the same surgery as Snarky -- cadaver tendon (I named him Slim) and laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic means they use a robot-type thing so that there are a few small incisions as opposed to slicing you open. I echo everyone else to take care of yourself, be diligent with PT, and try not to stress too much. My tear was in college and I went on spring break to Mexico the following week. It was actually pretty funny/ridiculous because I got a spot up front on the airplane so my leg could be extended and was escorted through the airport in a wheelchair. Plus I learned how to ask, \"Can I put my crutches behind the bar?\" in Spanish lol. My friends still ask if I can tear or break something before vacations so that they can get special treatment",
				"Hi Lauren,My fiancee tore her ACL and Meniscus a few months ago and is getting surgery on Tuesday. Out wedding is on October 19th and she was told by the doctor that she probably wont be able to dance or do too much. I found your post and was wondering if you could share your experience with me? She is having a really hard time right now and we are co suffering postponing our wedding for her to heal, but she feels she is letting me down. I would love any advice you might have, and would love to hear how much activity you were able to do on your big day. Thank you so much!"

I just called a medspa and scheduled a consultation for June 2nd, and she cautioned me about waiting until after the wedding because it can change your appearance. The whole reason I want it is for the wedding. Now I'm unsure what to do!",
			"comments": [
				"If I remember correctly, you certainly don't need it.",
				"I wouldn't do it for the first time right before the wedding. It takes time to learn how many units work best.",
				"It seems risky to try botox or fillers for the first time right before your wedding. You don't know how your body might react or if you'll like the way it looks. You don't need botox anyways",
				"Why would you do that? I don't think there is any need, and specially before your wedding. So people react to it, so if you want to experiment- do it after your wedding",
				"I wanted to get it done a month before the wedding in case I bruise. I appreciate the responses that I don't need it but I have lines around my mouth and crows feet that I hate!",
				"Do not take the risk of a procedure like that before your wedding. You don't know how your body will react.",
				"I wouldn't take that risk. You don't know how your body will react to the botox.",
				"I still wouldn't do it for the first time a month before. I'm very pro-botox if it makes you feel good, I've been getting it in my forehead since i was 24 and love it. But the first few times I looked kinda frozen. It took a bit to find exactly the right amount of units that gives me a very natural look.",
				"Make absolute 100% sure that you go to someone who knows what they're doing, and a lot of this worry will be unnecessary, I promise. I wouldn't suggest Botox around the mouth, instead they'll likely do a filler that will help plump any lines there. As far as Botox for crows feet, Botox works better than any jar of eye cream, and in most cases, the results are beautiful. An experienced injector should be able to determine the proper units to inject, and where, to give you the best results. Make sure you tell them you want the look as natural as possible. Sometimes if you inject only around the crows feet/eye smile lines, that's when a person could look frozen, so they may also inject around your brow, forehead, and 11's to ensure you get an overall even aesthetic. Good luck!",
				"Right before the e-shoot, my photographer asked me what my concerns were. I told him about some scars I had, where they were, and he edited them out of the photos. I would do that before I had a needle put in my face. Photoshop is a wonderful thing, and it's pain-free! lol",
				"I am debating as well, my hairstylist gets it and loves it. The reason I am on the fence is for reasons listed above.",
				"I second Photoshop Gymmie.",
				"With a little photoshopping those lines will go away. Getting it under your armpits for sweat management is one thing, but aggressive fillers or Botox can have you looking like Daffy Duck. Restylane is used in the folds around the lips and is more of an art form than Botox wait on it.",
				"Especially since the medically trained professional suggested it, I would wait until after the wedding. For the wedding itself, hire a pro makeup artist. For the pictures you plan on having reprinted and displayed, talk to your photographer about retouching those areas.",
				"Our engagement photographer (different than the one shooting our wedding) told me he could airbrush or photoshop and it looks like he did absolutely nothing! I hate our engagement pics so that's why it's even more important to me to have beautiful wedding pictures.I'm going to go for a consultation and see what they recommend, if anything.",
				"I regularly do Botox and I've had facial fillers and lip filler. I recommend it if you want it. But I do suggest going sooner rather than later, because you can bruise and swell.",
				"24 years old and getting Botox injections? Thanks, beauty magazines...",
				"I said it on another thread and I guess I need to say it again. America makes me sad sometimes.",
				"@Rachel, i promise it's not because of beauty magazines! I have a couple of deep lines in my forehead, and I hated looking at them, especially being as young as i was. Doing this is the one thing I do to pamper myself, i don't get my hair dyed, don't get my nails done. I do it for me, not because society said I needed it.",
				"Update - I went for a consultation at a plastic surgeon's office a couple weeks ago and got my Botox today! I did my crows feet and underneath my eyes. For anyone debating it - it was extremely quick and painless! I spent about an hour at the consultation and felt so good after talking to the nurse about what I wanted done, what I thought I wanted but she said I didn't need, etc. Can't wait to see my results!",
				"Hope you\u2019ve made the right decision for you. Anyway, I believe such things or decisions is always something personal. I mean, the first time I decided to get a Botox Wigan from this clinic, it was solely my choice alone. My sisters advised me not to do it so quickly, while others (my friends mostly) told me that it\u2019s actually a good idea. So if you can\u2019t really stand your wrinkles, then getting a Botox is a wise decision. Your choice."

				"Maybe try instead of completely cutting out fatty/sugary foods, just lower them. If you typically have 4 pieces of candy a day (just something easy to use as an example lol) cut it down to 2 or 3, then over time continue to cut it down. You could also use weekdays as your 'healthier' eating days, plan out what you're going to eat each day, keep a food journal (telling someone what you're eating helps too). Allow yourself to eat more of your favorite foods on the weekends. Overall, don't beat yourself up over anything, and be happy!",
				"View Quoted Comment I also try to find stuff on pinterest to make that's healthy so there is a variety. He really likes chicken wraps with spinach wraps right now. I tried a baked chicken pesto recipe the other night that went over well too. Lemon pepper fish too is something my FH has made it's very good too.",

				"Ive been on a pescetarian diet since I was a teenager so eating more greens and fruits and other veggies and just better protein choices really does give me more energy.",
				"I think eating healthy is easy if you enjoy it. Look up for healthy meals you enjoy eating. Or figure out how to make your favorite foods more healthy. I love eating avocado toast with egg and spinach it gives me the grain, protein, veggies, and healthy fat I need. Another thing I love to drink is a almond butter protein banana milk shake in my opinion it tastes better than a vanilla milkshake but it\u2019s actually healthy and tastes good. Never force yourself to eat healthy stuff you hate you will either go back to eating unhealthy stuff or hate yourself for it. Good luck",
				"I decided to try a month of nutrisystem meals. They sent me every meal/snack I would need for the entire month. There were also shakes I drank (from nutrisystem) that made the most difference in belly fat. I was always really bad at eating nothing during work and getting home and chowing down but with the pre made meals it kept me accountable for portions and eating consistently. It was really hard in the beginning because I felt the portions were so small but by the end I had lost 25lbs and the belly bloat that I hated. It was a good kickstart for me to realize how much I should actually be eating and how often. I know that was wordy but that was my experience with trying to eat healthy.",
				"Instead of deciding to cut too much out, I decided to focus on the things I want to add more of in my diet. More lean protein, especially fish. More green leafy veggies. More homemade breakfasts.Thinking of it as adding things that are good for you helps you not feel like you're cutting things out, but by filling more of your plate with the good stuff you'll inevitably eat less of the bad!I also eat everything on a smaller plate than my FH.

I did keto which is how I used to eat. The hardest was not to snack in the evenings while watching TV. Hubby (fianc\u00e9 at time) sometimes did evening walks. Figure out how to combat your weakness? Eat crap at home? Replace with healthy snacks. Bored at night watching TV? Walk or take up a hobby. Anything to break the bad eating patterns.",

I did However always hate working out and I have done that now for a month straight. My diet is next just need to find what works",
				"Remember that motivation is fleeting. It\u2019s discipline that keeps you moving toward your goals. If you struggle with accountability (like I do!), look into a coach. Mine has me track my food and macros with weekly weigh ins, biweekly pictures, and monthly measurements. I also send her pictures of my workouts when I\u2019m done to keep me accountable in that area. It\u2019s less expensive than a personal trainer (which I also did for 2 years and saw amazing results with) but gives me the knowledge that someone else will hold me to my goals, especially when the motivation isn\u2019t there. If you\u2019re interested, she\u2019s got a free Facebook group called Free to Be Nutrition. There\u2019s lots of information on there if you want to check it out.",

				"For our house, not having temptation of bad food made it easier. Every week, we meal planned and bought all our groceries. We didn't have ice cream/pop/cookies in the house so we didn't have the option of snacking on those. We didn't eat out since we had food in the fridge already, that was ready to cook and healthy.

				"View Quoted Comment Working out helps! But I was shocked a trainer said diet is 80%. Whoa, 5 miles on a bike and core workout is fantastic. I would think you'd see a lot of weight loss in 30 days. I didn't realize how fast carbs packs on the pounds. My hubby & I snack every night watching TV--UGH. We switched to pistachio nuts (which are distracting too because your hands need something to do). I also really like cheese nips (just baked cheddar cheese). Cucumbers with dip are ok in the summer. I swear by keto. I was thin my entire life until the past few years... when I sadly discovered how yummy carbs are (pasta, bread, potatoes). Chips have always been my weakness but my hubby NEEDS junk food around and I NEVER kept it around because I have no control. lol. I have to learn but I've asked him to at least get crap I don't like (he loves grocery store cookies and cake--ew). You can do it! I also found adding fresh lemon to water in the morning before the gym and then drinking a protein drink SLOWLY helps me eat less during the day. Sometimes, if I start with something bad for breakfast (with potatoes, bread or a donut if someone brings them to work), I'm hungrier sooner and crave sugar.",
				"Keto is an easy one because you stop craving sweets completely, it just eventually hardwires your food cravings. I have a notorious sweet tooth and the only thing that helps is to eliminate the cravings all together because my willpower(what willpower?) is pathetic.",
				"I don\u2019t diet because I don\u2019t believe diets work. I *have* been trying to eat healthier and exercise more because I want to feel strong in my dress. When I\u2019m on the treadmill, I listen to our first dance song and that motivates me to keep going. Honestly, I think it\u2019s great you love food. Food is awesome! Maybe focus more on feeling healthy? And try to eat more foods that help you feel good in your body. \u2764\ufe0f",

Fingers crossed I see What I want to see!",

				"This is going to sound really corny but I printed out motivational quotes and put them up around my house, especially on my fridge and in my kitchen because eating is my problem too. I actually started doing intermittent fasting because it forces me to not snack at night, which is my biggest crux. Like others said it's good to always envision yourself skinny on your big day but even that isn't enough sometimes. Here are some of my favorite motivational quotes: https://www.openfit.com/20-motivational-quotes-to-help-you-reach-your-fitness-goals",

Have pictures of your dress, maybe a special bathing suit or lingerie that you want to wear on your honeymoon and keep it somewhere where you will see it every single day!!

I think I been stress eating, and I just need a little bit of weight to be okay. My plan is to start on monday really hard. Any advice please \ud83d\udc96 Please I need to be comfortable in my dress and be happy!",
			"comments": [
				"Crash dieting can be really bad for your health but, you could try going for a more plant-based, lean protein diet. Intermittent fasting also has some evidence for efficiency in sustained weight loss.",
				"Where do you need to lose weight? In your arms?",
				"Weight watchers for 2 months, lose around 10 lbs and will help cut out the stress eating.",
				"View Quoted Comment My dress is off the shoulder so exactly that band is the one that is like killing my arm and maybe my back its a corset dress thats the reason that had me more comfortable but now im panicking. And hate the bridal sizes are so body shaming!",
				"Any workouts or exercises? My friend told me not to weights so my arm doesn\u2019t get bigger and concentrate in cardio right now.",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh ok. Just be careful if you done exercises because you could make it worse. I would watch your carbs, drink lots of water and do cardio. Good luck.",
				"View Quoted Comment I'd do cardio AND weight training, but not your arms. Doing heavy leg press, hack squats (machine weights may help if you aren't experienced / not uncomfortable with like free weights - you didn't mention your experience level in the gym) will build more muscle and burn calories around the clock. Hit the bike high intensity. Up your lean protein (eggs, grilled chix, lean turkey), green veggies and fiber. When I'm cutting weight (competitions), I eat sauteed cabbage and poached eggs with no salt to cut the water retention as well. Shredded purple cabbage and a little bit of apple cider vinegar and garlic is actually not as bad as you would think and it fills you up.Good luck!",
				"View Quoted Comment My understanding is that lifting weights is going to help you lose fat quicker than cardio and dieting alone. In two months I don\u2019t think your arms will get bigger from lifting weights. I think it will actually promote fat loss quicker. Think about how long it takes to make a small arm into a large muscular arm. People spend years trying to get those \u201cgains\u201d. The fat will go first and I don\u2019t think you could build the same girth of muscle in 2 months. But I\u2019m not a big fitness person so idk for sure!",
				"Also in two months you are not going to increase the size of your arms with weights substantially (but bicep curls won't help you reduce arm fat either). I always get miffed with those comments, since I'm the girl out here TRYING to increase my bicep size and it's flipping tough. Lol",
				"View Quoted Comment Yas thank you. I'm over here eating 8 eggs a day and curling 25lbs fighting for a .5 inch gain. Lawd.",
				"Weight lifting is going to help you lose weight. You can not target fat loss to any one area of you\u2019re body. It\u2019s not possible. Working out by weight lifting burns more calories than cardio alone and burns then throughout the whole day. Your arm will not get crazy buff in that amount of time \ud83d\ude02 definitely weight lift",
				"View Quoted Comment Hahah you go girl! Get it!",
				"My wedding is in two months as well. I have been stress eating and the dress is tight. Knowing, this I am consciously watching what I eat. Focusing on more veggies, and a lot more water. I am also making sure I'm consistent with my workouts. I'll allow treats only if I worked out and that is a piece of chocolate not the whole candy bar. I also take a little extra time before bed to mindfully breathe. Focus on relaxing and lett in ng the stress of the day melt away.Good luck and congrats, it's almost time!!!",
				"I would focus on diet more than exercise. I am cutting out unnecessary bread and sugar before the big day. I lost 10 pounds in two months just from changing my eating habits and taking a short walk every afternoon.",
				"Try cutting carbs. My neurologist put me on a modified Atkins diet where I track my food and stay under 25 carbs a day and I\u2019ve lost 50 lbs since April. That\u2019s without any real exercise as well besides long walks.",
				"I've been doing Weight Watchers since January and I am down 32 pounds. It's slow going for me but I also don't want to lose too much - my dress fits perfectly now and I don't want to have to pay to get it taken in.",
				"Low carb eating is a great way to lose weight fast. I recently cut out sugar from my coffee and I have lost 10 pounds in two weeks just from that.I wish you the best of luck.",
				"If you want to lose weight, nothing is more important than eating healthy and following a diet. Use a TDEE calculator to calculate how many calories you burn in a day. Eat 20-30% of that number and you will lose weight. This is called a caloric deficit and is the base of all diets. Download an app like LoseIt or MyFitnessPal to track your calories. Along with eating healthy, you can do some HIIT exercises to kick the weight loss into overdrive: https://www.openfit.com/5-of-the-best-exercises-for-burning-fat",
				"Focus on veggies and go to bed feeling like you\u2019ve fully digested your food. Sleep is when the magic happens!",
				"View Quoted Comment When I read that I said in my head \"well damn, how much sugar is she putting in her coffee!\" that's a crazy impressive weight loss.Congratulations and keep it up! Clearly you're doing the right thing.",
				"View Quoted Comment Not much sugar actually, but I usually drink about 4 cups of coffee a day at home. It's crazy to see how much weight is from sugar. My doctor said it's also because I have quite a bit to lose. I was type 2 diabetic (for 2 years) but my numbers are now in the normal range. I get another round of meds but at the next blood draw if numbers are still normal than diabetes med will be done. Also, with cutting out the sugar I have increased my water intake. So that probably helps right there too.",
				"View Quoted Comment Unfortunately there is no such thing as targeted weight loss. Every persons bodies hold it in and lose it in different areas. Personally when I start losing weight my arms and hips lose the weight but I still retain the \"mom pooch\" I would concentrate on cardio as your friend stated because thats just good for overall weight loss, and then I would try growing other areas that in turn result in muscles being worked inadvertently.",
				"View Quoted Comment That's really great - I bet you're saving a crap ton from (hopefully) not having to be on extra meds longer. I definitely have to work on the water piece - I feel like I switch between black coffee and beer as my two main drinks in the day (+ protein shakes). lol Definitely holding me back from being as cut as I would like.",
				"View Quoted Comment I am, but I am mostly glad that I found a \"diet\" that is working well. Just as long as I can keep it off. But, as soon as my car is back in working mode I can get my booty back to the gym.",
				"No carbs! You got this",
				"View Quoted Comment This!! And make sure you drink enough water",
				"My sister swears by intermittent fasting. Might be something to look into. She lost 10 pounds in a couple of weeks.",
				"The fastest way to loose weight is by cutting carbs. I think you should lift weights though since building muscle help to burn fat. While you might be scared you'll look \"bulky\", really you'll look more toned if you do weights. Just remember that muscle weigh more than fat so don't panic if scale number goes up. You should measure the size of your arms with a measurement tape and measure your arms again few weeks later."

			"title": "Surgery before Wedding. Yikes.",
			"content": "After enduring some pain and a lovely trip to the ER, I have found that I need to have emergency surgery tomorrow. We are less than 3 weeks out from my wedding (Aug 10) and honeymoon out of the country. I've been told that 2 weeks should be a good recovery time, but 3-4 weeks is preferred. Has anyone else been in this type of predicament? Not even necessarily for a wedding but other big events? I'm glad the pain will be over and its getting done ASAP, but I'm also extremely stressed over this impacting my wedding and honeymoon. I know its very superficial, but obviously we all put so much effort and thought into our big day for so long and it is scary to know that something like this could really kill all that.I guess at this point Im just looking for comfort and good thoughts/prayers/whatever you believe in for success in surgery and a speedy uncomplicated recovery. And for the least stressful final weeks of wedding planning possible haha",
			"comments": [
				"Good luck and wishing you a quick recovery!FH has been having stomach problems lately and is worried they're going to tell him he needs surgery and that he'll ruin the wedding. If you can be getting surgery before your wedding in August and still be okay I think that even if he does need surgery (which I don't think he will) he'd be good to go for our wedding in September. Maybe hearing your story will help put his mind to ease a bit.",
				"Wishing you a speedy recovery. Follow doctors orders to a T for the speediest recovery. Trying to do too much too soon can make things worse. Good luck!",
				"I think it all depends on the type of surgery you're getting as well as your career. I had a large, painful cyst removed last year, as well as my appendix. Doctor recommended two weeks recovery, which I absolutely NEEDED. I have a desk job. If I was on my feet all day at work, the doctor would have recommended at least another week of recovery. About a week after my recovery time, I got on a plane to Boston to attend a wedding for one of FH's friends. I wore a loose dress and wedges. I was slightly uncomfortable, but luckily I didn't have to stand for too long. and it was only for a weekend. Absolutely follow your doctor's orders for recovery. Your doctor will also tell you if it's ok to fly out of the country for your honeymoon. I wish you the best of luck on your surgery.",
				"Hey Ashley! I hope that everything went well with your procedure yesterday. Take lots of rest and I am hoping that you have a speedy recovery. I know the timing may not have been ideal but your health really is the most important thing you have so take your time to feel better. Once you are starting to feel better, perhaps you would be able to ask some of your close friends or family members to assist you with tasks that you are not up to yet. It's important to not overexert yourself and ask for help when and where you need it. Feel better Ashley!",
				"It can be done! I had two medical issues that finally came to a head this year, but I was lucky to schedule my 2 surgeries early enough in the year that they will actually make the wedding easier for me. But there were a lot of other things I had to worry about, and it was really stressful for both of us. I gave myself 6 weeks in between mostly because the first was a foot surgery that prevented me from walking for a few weeks. The second surgery was actually easier to recover from but I had to really follow all of the Dr's orders, So here is what I learned. First, take time for you so you can recover properly. Make sure you ask for help!!! Prep in advance, get whatever adaptive equipment you may need and get your home situated if you will have restrictions. Ask any questions about what you can and can't do keeping in mind all of the things we think of doing when we're getting married and honeymooning. Listen to your Dr and your body, and breathe! Good luck and fast healing.",
				"Oh wow. It is a good thing it is getting taken care of but the added stress will keep you from healing quickly so try to get lots of rest and don't be afraid to ask for help with any planning that remains. You have to be well enough to enjoy your big day and amazing honeymoon!!",
				"Thank you guys for the kind words! the surgery went well and now Im in recovery mode, have been following the directions and not trying to do anything too soon. I will say that even though it is so close to the wedding day, I am so relieved and happy that we went ahead and did the surgery now and I won't have to worry about it in the future! Ill have to start delegating the last of the duties now"

Are there any other people out there who have struggled with anything similar? I\u2019ve heard the wedding day can be super tiring and I\u2019m kind of anxious my body is gonna do something without my permission.any advice?",
			"comments": [
				"I have Lupus, migraines, and chronic pain as well as PTSD. I learned a long time ago to overplan but let it go if things don\u2019t go right. I know my body and what I can handle so I\u2019m setting the expectations for what I can accomplish low. We\u2019re having a small wedding so that helps with keeping things less overwhelming. I\u2019m kind of attacking it from the same perspective I do anything else big. Built in rest time, comfortable clothing, evenly distributed hair, sunglasses on hand.",
				"I don't have a chronic illness, but I do have chronic pain that is usually well managed. However, that can change due to stress, the weather, level of physical activity, or sometimes for no reason at all. I'm concerned I'll have a flare up on my wedding day. I plan to talk to my Dr about having a backup plan for a steroid in case I run into trouble. Can you work with your Dr to have a backup plan in place in case you have problems? Something that you wouldn't normally do, but can do if needed? For example, if you normally take over-the-counter meds for your migraines, could the Dr give you a 2-3 day supply of a prescription med for migraine just in case the over-the-counter doesn't work that day and the days around it? You wouldn't even have to purchase the med, just have it on file at the pharmacy in case you need it. I suggest having it at the pharmacy, so you just have to call them to have it filled, rather than having to call your Dr on your wedding day, getting the answering service, waiting for him or her to call back, then call the pharmacy, then someone has to go pick it up. All while you're trying to have a wedding and deal with how you feel physically. As far as what you can do on your own? Stay as stress-free as possible. Delegate tasks to your family and friends. Take breaks for a few minutes where you just sit down and be still. There was one bride on here with a chronic illness who specifically chose a venue that had a room off of the main guest area where she could go rest for a few minutes without it being noticed. Drink plenty of water, especially if you're having alcohol. Since that's a common trigger for migraine, you want to balance the water and alcohol. Make sure to eat a balanced breakfast and lunch. Have a high protein snack. Be as well rested as you can be during the week before the wedding. Try to have any projects done before wedding week, so you aren't staying up till 2 a.m. finishing up. If possible, avoid any foods/activities that trigger your symptoms. I know this is a lot, but I hope it helps some. I know the concern that your body is going to betray you on your special day. All you can do is prepare as much as possible. Have backup plans in place. And try not to worry too much about it, so that doesn't cause symptoms. Good luck! You'll have a beautiful day!",
				"I don't have any chronic illness, but when I get overwhelmed or am in social situations for too long my body tends to respond strongly, bloating and dizziness and such, so I was worried about how my wedding day was going to go as well. What really helped me was taking one thing at a time and trying to just breath. I had a good hour to myself that morning in the hotel room where I just took a bath, watched some free cable and focused on relaxing to start the day. Then it was one thing at a time, just focusing on that part of the day and trying to stay in the moment. And don't forget to drink water! Have a big water bottle on hand for all the getting ready phase, you don't need to add dehydration to your list of problems! I also agree with talking to your doctor about having a plan for if it gets too bad, if for nothing more than the extra piece of mind. Just remember to breath and enjoy your day!",
				"Oh yea I had organ failure a few years ago and it left me with all kinds of chronic problems. I'm scheduling my wedding to be during hours I know my body functions best at, I am carving out the time to sleep, and sleep late if possible, for me rest is the biggest factor in symptoms. I'm going to make sure I eat before, during, and after, thankfully all my guests know I have health issues and will probably remind me to eat vs trying to get me to dance or talk right away. Water. I suck at remembering to drink it, my fiance is already working on making sure I drink enough. As for before I'll probably stock pile medication, and try really hard not to do anything 2-3 days before. I'll have to deligate tasks and I hate doing that.",
				"I don't have an illness but I suffer from a rare nerve condition, in my face (eye roll). Like the worst place to have a nerve condition lol. I guess I have had it since I was born but didnt really make anything of it since my mom had always suffered from headaches and migraines (I had them terribly growing up). I had to have surgery to fix my nose and ever since then I was in even more pain. The last straw was when I had a migraine that lasted over a week. I went to multiple doctors and had multiple MRIs brain scans and CT scans. Finally they diagnosed me with some rare nerve condition that effects the nerves on the left side of my face. I guess my nerves and my blood vessels are too close together or sitting on top of each other causing them to swell and cause pain. What happens is when I get over stressed, hot or over exert myself they swell, my face starts to hurt and then I'm down for the count. Its something I now have to be on medication for for the rest of my life and will probably never feel \"normal\" again. Your not alone. Try to take it easy and good luck with everything!",
				"I have a seizure disorder that had been under control for years until January. I\u2019ve had 9,000 tests done and I\u2019m on new medication that seems to be working well, but my one fear for that day is that I will be so stressed that I will have a seizure during the ceremony or reception. Fingers crossed the next 4 months go smoothly.",
				"The good thing is you have over a year. Depending on your budget, you may want to look into a day of coordinator or even full wedding planner to help with the stress. In my opinion, plan as much as you can now & in advance, so the day & week of isn't stressful. Plan a massage & relaxing day a few days before, go on a date with your fiance the week of, etc. Don't leave stuff until the last minute. On the day of, make sure you sleep in & get a good night's rest, eat a good breakfast, eat throughout the day, and are as stress free as possible. I'm sure your parents & bridesmaids will step up to help that day too!",
				"I have a connective tissue disorder that causes pain, migraines, fatigue and dislocations of my joints. On my wedding day I took it as easy as I could before the ceremony. I had family members help with the setting up part and taking down stuff after the wedding. I made sure to take some medicine beforehand and made sure I had some with me. I was so busy talking to everyone and dancing that I didn't feel the pain until after my husband and I got home. I would try to let people who you trust to help as much as they can so you and your FH don't stress yourselves out. Realize that it is ok to go take a break or a breather for a moment at your wedding. I hope your wedding is amazing and your body cooperates and you are not alone!",
				"Thank you guys so much!",
				"I have severe Gastroparesis, POTS, EDS and chronic hives (yay!). Basically trying to keep everything as stress free as possible as well as a late afternoon/evening ceremony when my stomach feels it\u2019s best. That will also give me all day to get ready without feeling rushed. If I need a break, I have plenty of time. We are staying at the venue and my hair and makeup artists are coming to us, so I literally just need to roll out of bed, lol!",
				"Yes, weddings can be super stressful and are usually not without hiccups/mishaps/issues. One of the best things you can do is delegate tasks to people who are willing to help and whom you trust. Trying to do everything yourself will totally set off those symptoms. Be sure you have your medication (if applicable), some smelling salts, and drink plenty of water. Take a few minutes alone and just focus on breathing. Give yourself a pep talk. You are more than your condition, remember that! That's what usually helps me. I have anxiety, high blood pressure, and diabetes so I definitely understand how stress, fatigue, and migraines can completely drain you and ruin your day but all is never lost! At the end of the day, you'll still be with the ones you love, you'll be married, and you'll still have a lot of great memories.",
				"I have chronic lyme, chronic migraines, gastroparesis, anxiety... one or two others. But I feel you in that I get dizziness/fainting and fatigue ( I\u2019m also incredibly nervous about how I\u2019ll get through my whole wedding day! I was a MoH in my friend\u2019s wedding in March and I found that most of the people in the wedding were happy to help if I needed to sit suddenly or needed water/something to get my blood sugar up. It was comforting that it wasn\u2019t even my day and strangers were so accommodating.My advice, as someone who has lived with various chronic illness + socialization issues since high school is to not hide your needs/symptoms from any vendors that will be with you the day of. Make sure your wedding party is aware of any potential problems and how to handle them. It might feel embarrassing if they don\u2019t know about what you\u2019re going through but you need a good support system especially for such a long and important day. Also Please do NOT think you\u2019re being a bother to anyone for asking for w for any medical issues... that\u2019s something I wish I could tell every chronically ill bride or groom to be... you should feel supported and well prepared for whatever might happen the day of. Emergency Kits for the day of are total life savers btw!!! Maybe have one for anyone you need with medications, phone numbers, anything illness related and one with the standard stuff they suggest! Good luck!!",
				"View Quoted Comment This is so helpful! Thank you for taking the time to write this",
				"My fiancee has COPD and makes breathing normally tough. Stress does make it worse. One of the reasons we're having a fall welling is the cooler temperatures",
				"Yes. I have an herbal supplement I like to take when things are getting crazy, and I'll be sure to have some of that on hand. It helps my anxiety like meds never could, and my therapist told me long ago to keep it around. In terms of other issues, my FH has stomach problems that can be made worse if he doesn't watch his diet, so I know the week of the wedding he's going to be on a pretty strict chicken and rice diet. As for migraines....... I'll have my typical ibuprofen 800s and chamomile tea on hand!",
				"My FH has side effects from a surgery he had as a kid and I have seizures.In preparation I've been training more of my bridesmaids the proper thing to do if I go down (stress can make conditions worse you know). I've been talking to my doctor more (as much as I can afford you know, but that's a separate rant) and monitoring my body and reactions closer.My FH will go numb in his arms from time to time so he's been trying to not work as hard or mess up his arms any further. I'd say it's all about knowing your limits and not skipping meds if you take themGood luck and I hope it becomes more manageable for you",
				"Yes to all of the above! Just remember to prioritize your health over the wedding, especially in the days/weeks/months leading up to the big day. The day of, consider assigning someone who won't be drinking to be a runner in case a trip to the store or the doctor's/urgent care/ER is needed. Consider consulting your doc for more or different emergency/abortive meds beyond what you currently have if you think they won't withstand the pressure of a full wedding day. Have a plan for if you do feel something coming on, and pay attention to your body so that any pain can be prevented immediately. As someone with chronic migraines who also faints, this is my best advice",
				"View Quoted Comment I have gastroparesis as well (and POTs, EDS, anxiety, and a couple others). My FH, sister (my MOH) and I have set everything up to be as stress free as possible for me. We have the venue starting on Thursday, so it will be a mini vacation with the entire bridal party. Friday evening the rehearsal will be there and Saturday morning, the hair and makeup people are coming to us, so all I have to do is roll out of bed, lol. My sister is planning on stocking the house with food for the weekend and so she will be sure that I have plenty of foods that I can eat readily available.",
				"I'm bringing Advil for pain and planning to take it easy in between events, and make sure I don't overdo it. There's a chance I may get dizzy or nauseous at the wedding, but if I do, I'm not going to let it ruin my day. Maybe designate a bridesmaid to be on \"watch\" for any symptoms you may have, and if she sees them, to politely whisk you away somewhere you can sit quietly and rest for a while.",
				"You're not alone. The trick is knowing your body, and building in supports that you need throughout the day. If you need to step out for a moment, do so. If you know you'll need someone there when you get overwhelmed, then make sure they know the signs. If there's meds you need, have those tucked away somewhere that you can easily access them.Essentially, have a back-up plan so if the unexpected happens, you at least have some resources in place to accommodate them."

				"View Quoted Comment Yeah I love it! I love how they have shorter options and ones without needing weights or dumbbells!",
				"Hi! Like FutureMrsD had mentioned I also gathered from your post that you were looking for ab workouts because your \"stomach size bothers you...and you want a flatter stomach\". And unfortunately you can't spot reduce - meaning you can train abs every day but it won't shed fat from that area. I see that you're already doing cardio by biking so that's great! But you also need to focus on your nutrition to get a flatter tummy. Once your bodyfat gets to a certain lower percentage then that's when abs can start to come into play",
				"View Quoted Comment That\u2019s good to know thank you. Yes I do bike daily I want to add ab workouts to the cardio from that. My wording was a little off. My diet is a work in progress to say the least lol. It\u2019s next on my list to change.",
				"Getting a flat stomach is a combo of cardio and nutrition for sure. And you're aware that it's next on your list so you can do it! Getting actual abs though you'll need to do weight training but if it's just to look better in a bikini I think cleaning up your nutrition will definitely help!",
				"As people are not understanding the wording (my fault sorry) I am Looking for an ab workout to add onto my current cardio that I do (bike riding) my goal would be a flatter stomach but I am NOT expecting a single ab workout to do that.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yes for now it is just for the flatter stomach for the bikini. I am doing cardio just wasn\u2019t doing any core strengthening type exercises which is why I asked for ideas. I think combined they do a better job of working the whole body. I have A hard time sticking to things and new ideas help. Once I have that down I will be working on the horror that is my diet lol",

I have had several foot surgeries and have high arches which causes a problem with ankle stability and my nerve. I used to do Zumba but can\u2019t do it any longer due to this. It\u2019s another reason I asked for specific ab exercises since most are on the floor. (I suppose I should have been wayyy more specific in my posting) I can do biking/walking because it is low impact. I even have trouble doing yoga/Pilates sometimes which is also something I have tried. \u2639\ufe0f If you have any low impact full body recommendations I would Love them.",
				"I do 21 Day Fix Abs for most of the moves - and the tempo. I have subbed out some of the moves though for moves the concentrate on my lower abs. I like the program because it's twisting and not super complicated. There is also an old Gaiam Pilates DVD that I really like - it's the 30 mins one.",
				"View Quoted Comment If you're able to go to a gym there are a ton of full body workouts you can do. Doing \"compound lifts\" or exercises that target and require your body to use several muscles at once like squats, bench press and deadlifts are great exercises and they're all low impact.

Interval training tends to give great results when it comes to slimming down, try to sprint a minute, walk 2, sprint a minute and so on on the treadmill. If you're only exercising 1-3 times a week, try 4-5 times instead, you can incorporate abs 3x a week along with cardio so that as you lose body fat in your stomach you'll have some muscle tone.",

My mother was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer right after I began planning originally so I put things on hold. I had gotten off my antidepressants around the same time because I felt I no longer needed them. I overcame a lot this last year to try and heal from the meds. (I had a bad withdrawal coupled with external stress). I struggled with the idea of elopement vs a wedding because of money and my anxiety issues. We decided last week to hire a wedding planner for a 20 person intimate ceremony in my grandpas backyard. I can just barely afford it. I am planning it in a 3 month period because of my mothers health. As soon as I signed the contract I became overwhelmed with dread and worry. Which turned to horrifying panic. I ended up with severe stomach issues which havent ended. My anti anxiety meds dont help. I saw my doctor and she gave me a script for the med I was on previously. I am so scared it will not work in time, or make things worse for me. I also am scared to start a med just because of a trigger like this. But I want to be able to enjoy my day and the planning and be able to function for work. Right now I literally cannot. Has anyone had to get on an antidepressant to get through their wedding?

I decided to see my doctor end of October and he told me I might have GERD or an Ulcer. So he gave me Carafate for a month it also did not work :/. He then gave me Omeprazole for a month and told me to schedule an appt with a Gastro about an EGD and Barium Swallow(which was all the way out into Jan), the burning still didnt go away. During my Barium test they saw that it was normal and they also didn't see any damaged issues in my Endoscopy. They gave me soda after that which was weird, because I still had the burning pain( i just gave it back). Since Jan I have been watching my diet, bland foods, no alcohol, staying away from triggers, and working out to lose weight. I am taking Omerprazole still for a month and the Gastro doc wants me to come back after the pills are done. I am just having a REALLY HARD TIME coming to terms with this. I just felt so destroyed that all of a sudden. I tried to think why this could have happened, was it the engagement in July/wedding planning stress, was it family and faily in law stuff, was it my job? There are so many things that go through my head now and every day I think and say what am I gonna eat next because it is so specific.

It took about 30 days to REALLY start working, and when it does, you will be so relieved! I also avoid almost all acids and liquor in my regular diet, but I will obviously eat/drink it if I really want it. I also altered my cooking, as too much pepper and certain seasonings really don't settle well with me (FH seasons his own food now)! I was so bad for a while even water gave me indigestion. Hang in there and give the medicine time to work! *Edit: have you talked to your doctor about bumping your dosage? Mine started me at once a day, but it didn't do hardly anything.

I take a probiotic enzyme daily and a medication from my doctor, which helps tremendously.

We ate stupid clean fora month ( no gluten, dairy, soy etc) and he realized that it was dairy that really worsened his acid reflux. I am a veterinarian ( people are different from animals obviously). A lot of dogs get something called bilious vomiting syndrome. It happens more frequently when their meals are spread too far apart or if they have a hiatal hernia. So if you want my 2 cents. I would try smaller more frequent meals. See how things go without certain foods. Ask about the potential of hiatal hernia ( you have to catch it at the right time). I agree you should have the gall bladder evaluated too.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yes youre right I should get it looked at. :/ Would you have any advice on how they handle social situations like parties/bachelorette parties, birthdays etc?",
				"I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this! I have GERD as well, and have taken a lot of the same steps as you. I\u2019ve had an endoscopy, gallbladder sonogram, and took omeprazole for years. The thing that has helped me the most has been cutting out gluten and limiting dairy. It has helped so much, I no longer require omeprazole. When I\u2019m having severe symptoms, I follow a FODMAP diet until I\u2019m doing better. You may also want to try a probiotic, that helped me tons. Good luck!",
				"I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with all this! I had similar issues almost a year back, although none of the symptoms presented as typical heartburn/acid reflux symptoms, but I was truly miserable. I got an endoscopy to see if it was celiac and while it wasn\u2019t that, they just said my esophagus and duodenum were very enflamed so I went on Pantoprazole for 3 months like you which sucked bc I had to take the morning pill 30 minutes before I ate which meant waking up at the buttcrack of dawn since I\u2019m hungry as soon as my eyes open in the morning. Long story short, I did not follow the rules of the medicine (no grease, no alcohol) but it still somehow cured me and I haven\u2019t had any issues since November. It sounds like your issues are more severe than mine, so all I can suggest is fully take control of managing your health. Pester doctors until you feel they are 100% on your side, make no apologies for having to change your lifestyle, and keep hope that your issues will soon be over one day, because they will!",
				"And as far as social situations, you just have to do what is best for you. Don\u2019t give in to peer pressure on drinking if you know the wine or fizzy drinks will cause problems for you later in the night. For the bachelorette, i would advise letting your friends know ahead of time your food restrictions and why. They will be understanding and find restaurants that you all can enjoy. It should be considered the same common courtesy as not taking a vegan friend to a bbq joint or a friend with celiac to a bakery.",
				"View Quoted Comment Im sorry too. :/ I am glad you have got it under control. How long have you had it and how long did it take for symptoms to go away for lower? I have cut out dairy too and tried vegan cheese instead, I havent had effects from it. I havent tried cutting gluten yet though.",
				"View Quoted Comment Wow. thats amazing im glad you were able to find relief! In my EGD they said everything was fine. No burns or inflammation. I was so confused still confused. And youre right I should let them know before hand thank you! I have had hard alcohol before like a mixed drink with soda on NYE but for some reason I did not feel pain. When i drank wine sometimes it would calm the acid feeling. But the doc said no so now im like darn it im scared.",
				"View Quoted Comment Yes it\u2019s all pretty confusing, especially since yours sounds more severe than mine was. Luckily 3 months was all it took for my inflammation to heal. I had my endoscopy literally the day before I left for my dream vacation so I was a little headstrong and did not heed the doctors warnings about greasy food and alcohol (I was in France, how could i *not* drink wine?!) and I definitely paid the price for it a few times but was lucky that it never made the issues worse. Definitely don\u2019t do what I did, i would avoid the alcohol even if you didn\u2019t feel any pain. The longer you give your body to heal and reset, the better I think. But I feel your pain on being young and feeling sick and having FOMO.",
				"Do you think maybe sometimes different types of PPI's work better than others? I noticed you were put on a diff med than I was does it work differently than Omeprazole?Did you reintroduce things back into your diet and if so when did you do it?I def have FOMO, I loved my social life before this. I had fun going to eat with friends my fiance and we loved to travel. Now its just -.-",
				"View Quoted Comment I had my endoscopy in October, and have cut out gluten and dairy since then. I started decreasing omeprazole from 40mg to 20, then to nothing. I phased out the omeprazole in about a month. Take your time and be patient! It takes a lot of experimenting to find what works best for you. FODMAP is good for adding things back slowly.",
				"I am assuming that you have been tested for H.pylori during your battery of GI tests?",
				"View Quoted Comment Hi Shannon-when I had my EGD they did an biopsy for an allergy but it was negative. During the EGD they looked for inflammation.",
				"I went through terrible stomach problems my freshman year of college. They diagnosed me with GERD and a hiatal hernia. I was put on prilosec and zantac at the same time. My doctor said that they work in different ways to help with stomach acid. Maybe try asking your doctor about being on both? I was at a point where I couldn't eat because of the pain and after about a year and losing more weight than I could afford to lose, those two meds helped me. I still take them on occasion when I start feeling bad again. Good luck though! I hope it gets better",
				"So many other lovely people with stomach issues! I have had pretty severe gerd since highschool. The valve between my stomach and esophagus doesn\u2019t work, it hands open all the time, so I end up seeing a lot of food again. I got put on omeprozole(40 mg once a day in the morning, I don\u2019t need much for it to be effective because I am 88lbs) as well. It didn\u2019t work at first, but after it built up it has made a diffeeence. While I still see food again, I don\u2019t get as much of the horrid acid burn, which I count as a victory. After years of trying all the medical options the gi specialists could think of they finally agreed to give me linx surgery! Which is still going to be 5 months out due to insurance mumbojumbo, but after the years I\u2019ve been dealing with it 5 months is nothing. I wat a diet of primarily bland foods. Nothing overly greasy or overly acidic. No sodas. I tend to eat a lot of things I know it won\u2019t be bad when I see it again like pastas and cheese sauces or things of that nature. I don\u2019t eat meat at all. I have a caffeine addiction so I still drink coffee despite the upset tummy it gives me. I don\u2019t drink near as much as I used to, but it is something I am willing to suffer for.",
				"UPDATE: I had ultrasound/sonogram of my gallbladder, liver, pancreas and everything came back okay. I have a PH level test EGD Next Wednesday to see if there is actually acid coming in to my esophagus .",
				"GERD can come on due to stress and things that you are eating. Starting with a diet and exercise is good. I have Gastroparesis,GERD and a hiatal hernia. I try to watch what I can eat and exercise. Try small meals and water as well and keep your stress levels to a minimum during the planning. You dont have a lower quality life just try to keep the stress down and that medicine may not work for you, you may need something else. Google GERD diet and such on the internet and develop a plan for yourself.",
				"UPDATES: Its def been a roller coaster of events and doctors. I had a ultrasound of my gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. Everything was fine. My DR. scheduled a Bravo study which is a ph level test for 96 hours. before I went and got that placed in my esophagus I went to lake Geneva for a weekend (at the time I had to be off all medicines). I decided what the hell and ate the options I wanted to and I even drank . With all of this I did not feel much but when I did I would take a Rolaids chewy which are very helpful. During the Bravo study I also ate out a bit more just to really test it( of course this was within my diet since im in the process of losing weight). So fast forward to yesterday and The doctor told me I have about 2% of acid going into my esophagus and a normal amount is about 5% since people normally have at least some acid that comes up. He said since this is the case and you feel it a lot you actually have something called Hypersensitive Esophagus. He is prescribing me Amitriptyline which is an anti anxiety and depressant but should help relax the nerves in my esophagus. He said i can take the rolaids and such if I want.. I have yet to get the prescription but hope he sends it today."

Of course, I have a fitness base and it was a change in routine, so that definitely had a little bit to do with it. It's not a massive transformation program, but it is no joke and helps your body recover as well as strengthen. Flexibility training helps with any further fitness you want to pursue as well, so if you already picked it up - good! Go for it! (Former personal trainer here, married to a current trainer/bodybuilder, so happy to help!)",

My favorite Piyo workouts are the one w/ the slides (frisbees work on rugs & paper plates work on hardwood floors for much cheaper lol).Turbofire is a great (old) beach body workout, that really helps w/ weight loss.

			"title": "Losing weight before dress shopping?",
			"content": "Hi everyone. You may have seen a post from me a few weeks ago about a health condition that I am currently being treated for. During this condition, I gained a significant amount of weight, around 60lbs. Which really sucks! However, it is known that after you treat this condition you can get back to your normal weight within a few months. In January, I was treated and I am looking to start going to the gym daily to (hopefully) quickly lose the weight. As of now, I wanted to try to go dress shopping early April for my October wedding.My question is, when do you think is the absolute last month I could look for a dress? I know that it can take up to 8 months for a dress to come in, but are there dresses that don't take that long? or that you simply purchase in the store and are available that day? of course alterations are a factor too. I haven't gone dress shopping yet and I've really debated this. I know for a fact that I will probably get back to my normal weight (around 120), and I am scared if I buy a dress at my current weight it will definitely be too big when it comes time for the wedding. If I bought a dress now it would be a size 14 (or 16/18 in wedding dresses) and I am normally a size 8 or 10. Can my dress be altered that significantly? Can I wait to get my dress? I would rather be healthy again over worrying about if I will get the perfect designer for my dress. I don't have a particular dress in mind yet. I just feel sort of lost on what I should do. Thank you for your thoughts!",
			"comments": [
				"Take a look at BHLDN. They carry a limited line of designer gowns at various price points. If you live near one of their brick and mortar stores, you won't walk out with the dress that day, but should have it within a week. My daughter purchased hers on a Monday and had it that Thursday. Her veil took a couple weeks longer due to a temporary stocking shortage. If you order online, they allow for returns within a reasonable time window.As long as you have about six weeks, alterations shouldn't be an issue. I'd look for an independent seamstress as soon as you have your dress or even prior to shopping.",
				"Hi! First of all, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing better and your health condition is resolved. Regarding dress shopping, I\u2019d start a bit earlier, so that you know for sure which one is the dress and then you can go and just pay and order when you\u2019re ready. If your plans are to lose the weight before the wedding, you can always order it a size down. I ordered my dress a size down and when I received it I was 20 pounds lighter, it fitted me perfect (except for the hem, of course). Also, I\u2019d order it in March at the latest, in April you\u2019re cutting it too close to wedding date and they usually request 6-8 weeks for alterations. Ask your bridal salon for their policy on timing, mine requested at least 6 months before the wedding in addition to the time for alterations. Another bridal boutique requested 8 months.Regarding buying the dress at the moment, bridal salons and boutiques usually have the samples of dresses, therefore they don\u2019t sell them right then and there, they need to order yours, therefore the long wait time. I\u2019m aware that there are places where they sell those samples, therefore you can buy the dress and take it the same day, but alterations must be covered by you. Of course, these are less expensive dresses, because they\u2019re on a discount since they were samples. I\u2019m not sure about stores that have a variety of dresses (not samples) for you to try and take home. I hope this helps a bit, and I wish you success in your wedding dress shopping.",
				"I think 6 months would be the latest you should buy your dress. My dress took 4 months to come in, and I still have to have alterations done. I REALLY want to lose weight for my wedding, but I bought a dress that flattered the body I have now, that way if I lose the weight great and if I don't at least I know it will still look good. Also, they told me a seamstress normally can alter a dress down two dress sizes.",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you, Mim! I'll look into BHLDN and see if there's one in my area!",
				"View Quoted Comment Thank you so much for this! This is really helpful advice. I don't think I'll order a dress size smaller than I am, only because I'm so afraid of the scenario where I'm not able to lose the weight, or for some reason the health issue comes back and I have to deal with it for another few months, which could be possible!I completely understand about ordering the dresses and having them come in. I actually didn't realize it worked that way, lol! I'm glad that I know now. Thank you for explaining!I think I'll go ahead and workout now and try to see where I end up by March. If I lose the weight, great. If not, I'll order the dress size that I currently am and maybe talk to the seamstress about my concerns. Thanks!",
				"View Quoted Comment Hi Danielle, thank you for the advice. I'm glad to know that the seamstress can normally alter a dress down two sizes. I agree, I think I'll plan to shop by April 1st, and if I lose the weight in that time great, but if not I'll order the dress the size that I currently am!",
				"My wedding is this April 2019 and I didn\u2019t dress shop until December 2018 - I went to David\u2019s bridal and my dress was in at the end of January. Being altered rn - will be ready early May. However, I think they prioritize alterations based on when the wedding is so if you come in like a month before they\u2019d work on yours before a wedding that\u2019s in 3 months.also, the dress they ordered for me was a size bigger so they could \u201csculpt it\u201d so I\u2019d say yes most places can take a dress in (i hear it\u2019s more difficult to take it out). In fact, I\u2019d lost 7 pounds from the time I bought the dress till my alterations last week and they still were able to sculpt it and it looks great.if I were you, I\u2019d go look now (to see what you like) and then look again in April to see what size will be best. Or maybe the dress consultant can offer some advise",
				"Oops sorry I meant my dress will be in early MARCH not May lol that would be after my wedding lollllll",
				"If you buy a dress off the rack, you can take home that day and alterations take about 1 month. If you plan on doing that, you can wait until August. You can call local bridal shops and see if they sell off the rack or find a trunk show in your area. I found a boutique that sells sample dresses only and bought one there.",
				"View Quoted Comment Wow! I am happy to hear from someone that ordered their dress a little bit later than \"normal\". I have hopes that I will find a dress that doesn't take 6+ months to come in. I may be limited by choices but that's fine!

				"Another option with a shorter delivery window is Azazie. It's online, but you can order dresses to try on for a nominal price, and they do custom-sizes for the same price as standard.

Everyone kept telling me \u201coh no you need to go now!\u201d We got engaged in September but in early November we lost a very close family member unexpectedly so I just didn\u2019t care about wedding dress shopping I almost waited till January tbh.Granted, that was from a lager retailer not a local boutique they may not be able to accommodate the timeline.if you\u2019re wedding is in October though April seems like it should be fine.Good Luck!",
				"View Quoted Comment I didn't think about Azazie. I'll have to look into that, thank you!",
				"Honestly, April is late. My dress is taking 5 full months to arrive & an additional 2 months for alterations. It's easy to take a dress down 1-2 sizes. I'd just explain in advance to the salon & alterations person what your situation is.",
				"View Quoted Comment Thanks! I'm so happy to get various opinions. Okay maybe I will look in March lol. It's good to know that they can take the dress down a free sizes if need be.",
				"I'm in a similar but opposite situation. Had a condition where I ended up losing lots of weight quickly. Got treatment and it's expected that the weight comes back unless I update my eating and work out habits. Also wondering when I should go dress shopping.",
				"Seconding the BHLDN suggestion\u2014 there are a couple stores that are notorious for quick ship times, that being one (David\u2019s bridal being another!). You can also try consignment or off the rack (at any place that does like sample-style sales), but the down fall of a lot of sample sales is that the dresses are all pretty much one size and come as-is, and condition can vary greatly.THAT SAID! The above was the information I had in my head when I went shopping, also \u201clate\u201d , also largely due to recent weight gain at the time and not feeling my best, so I kept procrastinating. So, I did all the above first (worrying I\u2019d be laughed out of a regular boutique \ud83d\ude33). I had a great experience at BHLDN (I found some contenders but didn\u2019t have my moment), and then had less than great experiences at all the other places (the sample selection where I went was somewhat bleak). So, I did a little more poking around and realized some DESIGNERS have shorter turn around times, and I found a boutique that carried those designers. I shopped early March for a late August wedding...and ultimately had a great experience. Found a dream dress and some great contenders. So, your early April idea may not be too far off. I did have SOME limitations, for sure. But I told the salon my date and made sure they ONLY pulled dresses that they could get in on time (and I had a lovely selection). Also a number of designers have a rush option for a fee. But, timeline is something a shop should be able to help you with. I\u2019d say calling around and now and asking if they had dresses that could work with that timeline would be your safest bet!i will also say that while my late shopping worked out, it came with a little stress, and extra expense: my dress came in, as quoted, in 4 months. BUT it came in wrong\u2014 I received the wrong color. I super panicked that they wouldn\u2019t have time to fix it, but the shop was ON IT and the manufacturer replaced it in no time at all (lIke maybe 2 weeks?). BUT, the delay did cause me to miss my appointment and window with the seamstress I had selected, and I ultimately had to find someone new, ASAP. I had to pay a rush fee for the alterations, and think in my desperation I got a little screwed with costs (my previous seamstress find was after careful research to find someone affordable, and then in my rush I went for the best I couldget ASAP, and definitely paid a premium for it!)...short version: you\u2019re probably okay early april : you won\u2019t have your pick of ANYTHING in the store, but you\u2019ll have options still. But, don\u2019t push it off much longer than that, as it will potentially cause unnecessary stress down the road !!",
				"View Quoted Comment This is awesome advice, thank you soooo much!",
				"You can get sample dresses in store that day, but you are limited in selection. There are also websites online that you can order from that take about 1-2 months to come in, like JJshouse. I would definitely wait a few more months to lose the weight, then buy. My sister was taking steroids and gained over 50 lbs. She bought a dress a year in advance and then couldn't wear it. She lost so much weight they couldn't take it in enough. She ending up buying a prom dress off the shelf, which looked beautiful, but it was a waste of the first, expensive dress."

				"I'm not on BC either and I'm going to be on the 2 heaviest days of my period my period during my rehearsal dinner and wedding. Last month I tried pushing it back with no luck. This month (my wedding month) I'm going to try to speed it up. If I at least knock out the first 2 days of my period before my wedding I can make it through without cramps, bloating, overflow , etc. I'm doing this by taking ginger shots a few days before my period and I told my FH to gear up because we'll be having sex (TMI, I know) every day for at least a few days before my period. I'm also using a menstrual cup so that I don't have any overflow accidents like I would get from a tampon. I've used it for 2 cycles now and I'm in LOVE!The science behind it... Ginger stimulates the hormones related to your period and can send your uterus into shedding mode early (only a day or 2, nothing crazy). Sex, orgasms specifically, stimulate the uterus causing it to contract. If you are about to have your period, this can cause it to come a day or two early and end faster. Semen also has a chemical in it that triggers the uterus to contract and shed it's lining as well. So if you're already having premarital sex, I say go for the gusto a few days before and speed that sucker up. Hey, you'll probably relieve some pre-wedding stress and get closer to your FH in the process. I say it's a win-win.I'm not a scientist and I'm definitely not a doctor, I've just been researching non-hormonal ways to alter my period for the 4 last months... ever since I found out my period would be ON my wedding.Edit: Just a side note, doctors are now saying that the hormones from BC can stay in your system for up to 12 months after you stop taking it.

			"content": "Hi Ladies, I'm going to be on my period on my wedding day. Let me rephrase... I'm going to be on the worst day of my period on my wedding day. Cramps, bloating, period poops, fatigue, heavy flow, and soooo much more. It's not the bleeding that I'm worried about it's all of the side effects. I also want to note, I am not ashamed of my period and I am more than OK having sex with my FH on my period. Please don't be ashamed of your body in any way, embrace and love yourself!I've seen a few people posting about this and I've been researching it for about 4 months now to see what options are out there. I wanted to share some of what I found with you guys, just in case there is another bride out there in this same boat.So how do you avoid your period on your wedding day?1. The \"pill\", or any hormonal birth control (BC) - If you want to alter your period this is the easiest method out there. You should start a few months out and tell your doctor. If your period is due on the period week, your doctor will most likely tell you to skip the placebo pills (if you're on the pill specifically) and move right into the next pack. This is OK every once in awhile. The downside is that you will be adjusting your hormones with chemicals and it takes at least a month to adjust and the pill can cause weigh gain, nausea, bloating, acne, etc. If you're on the depo shot, talk to your doctor about when to start so that you won't have your period on your wedding day. Also so this with an IUD, the hormones release differently for these types of BC options, and it's best to communicate with your doctor about it.If you do not want to take BC (which I don't), there are still options. REJOICE!To speed up your period1. SEX - If you're already having premarital relations, just have it once (or more ) a day for a few days before your period. This should speed it up and make it come and go faster. The orgasms and the semen work together to stimulate contractions in the uterus which increase shedding on the lining. It will only induce a period that is already on its way and will only induce it a few days early.2. Natural herbs and food - I've heard ginger, parsley, turmeric, and vitamin C all help to stimulate hormones so that it will induce your period early. This will only have it start a few days early, not a week.3. Reduced Exercise - Exercise can reduce estrogen levels which can cause irregular periods or delayed periods. If you exercise, try taking a break and see if that induces your period.Delaying your period1. Exercise - Similar to #3 above, increased exercise (cardio mostly) can decrease estrogen, delaying your period. I would say this would need to be a month long commitment in order to make a difference in your period.2. Weight Loss - The more weight you lose and the faster you lose it, will effect your period. This is because weight loss triggers a stress response in the body and decreases the production of estrogen. This is not the safest way to delay your period and can be harmful to bone health if your period continues to be irregular. (I started a new diet and exercise routine in May and my period was actually early by 1 week, which is what caused it to fall on my wedding). Weight loss will effect everyone differently, but it usually delays your period.3. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) - Take 3 tsp a day 3 times a day for 7 days before your period. This is supposed to delay your period. It's an old wives tail but some people have reported it working. (I tried this last month and it did not work, I may have needed more ACV or may have needed to start sooner, either way it was disgusting and it was a wasted week).4. Stress - I'm sure most of us have experienced stress around something in our lives. With enough stress your body can delay your period. I am not saying to intentionally stress yourself out... in fact DO NOT intentionally stress yourself out! The reason I added this one, is because leading up to the wedding you may be so stressed and you may delay your period naturally. I know this was a long read, but if you're experiencing some stress and anxiety around having your period on or near your wedding day, I hope this helped at least put you at ease a little more.So what will I be doing for my wedding?I will be taking a shot of ginger every morning about 5 days before my period is due to start and I will be having sex with my FH every day at least a few days before my period is due to start and probably a for the first day of my period to help speed it up. I'm really hoping this works. If it doesn't I'll be using my menstrual cup with possibly a back up of period panties for any overflow, and lots and lots of MIDOL extra strength, and I'll use ground flax seeds in smoothies to help make my bowel movements more regular.",

				"Oh man this is great info. I was soo worried id be on mine (i dont really track it) but itll be a week prior yayyyy. I hope this works for you!! Good luck!",
				"I plan on doing the depo injection a month before my wedding. I'm in the medical field and most of us in office do it when we have big plans and don't want our period to show up until after.",
				"View Quoted Comment Genevieve, that's the awesome bonus. I'm flying for my wedding and the extra boost to my immune system with the ginger can only help!",
				"View Quoted Comment Oh yeah! I should probably add all of the hormonal birth control options *face palm*. I thought about the depo, but I do horribly on all hormonal BC, I even went on low low estren and I have terrible mood swings. Alas, I am out of luck with BC.",
				"Wow that is amazing information! I'm already on the pill so that is helpful but I will also try some of your tips too just to be on the safe side",
				"I literally just went to the dr to get back on BC to avoid this! I have never tracked my period before, but decided it was a good time to start... Because of all the wedding stress my periods have actually gotten heavier and cramp-ier... So I was thinking about getting on BC to lighten it a little. Weight gain is my biggest fear right now. I was looking at my predicted periods (using Flo app) and it was like Vegas Trip for Bach. Party, Birthday, thanksgiving, christmas, and wedding! and I was like NOPE!! Lets just change this! To get it perfect (after honeymoon), I need to start on Sunday! *Wish me luck* -- Also I don't want kids and going on honey moon and not having to worry about condoms will be a great perk!",
				"View Quoted Comment BC really is the easiest and most stress-free way to alter your period. Go for it girl, take control of your cycle!",
				"View Quoted Comment Have you ever used it before? Depo causes irregular spotting and heavier periods for lots of people. Actually the number 1 side effect.",
				"View Quoted Comment The mood swings are typically the estrogen, consider progesterone only forms like IUD, nexplanon, depo or progestin only pill",
				"Just throwing this out there: the Depo shot usually causes irregular &/or increased bleeding. I was on it for a year & never stopped having a period that whole time. If you are not currently using it I do not reccommend starting right before your wedding. It may in fact make things worse for you. To each their own, obviously, but I just wanted to share my experience with it & provide a warning. Best of luck to you all \u2764",
				"My period date just changed and had me starting on my wedding day and lasting through my honeymoon. I'm so pissed! I'm going on a cruise and I dont use tampons. So I'm screwed \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I feel like it's going to be the worst week ever",
				"View Quoted Comment I did the IUD for about 10 months and my cramps worsened and my periods were about 2.5 weeks long with spotting in between. I've tried a lot of different pills form the time I was 14 until about 21 when I had the IUD put in. I just didn't like how they made me feel, mentally, physically, emotionally. So I stopped it all together. I don't like to put anything in my body that has a chemically induced hormonal effect. It just hits me harder than most I guess. I know the options I gave above do effect hormones but it's a much more natural and subtle effect and it doesn't last nearly as long as the pill form.",
				"View Quoted Comment Hi Kate, that really stinks! Have you tried a menstrual cup? I've used one for about 2 cycles now and I'm in LOVE! It's a little messy, BUT once you get the hang of it and find the right one (this is key), I think it's a God-send. You can youtube so many helpful videos and really after the first cycle you will know how to really use it. It allows you to do all the things you would normally do while not on your period and you only need to change it every 12 hours (I do 7am and 7pm).",
				"I love that everyone is so open about this! Great info thank you! Hope this works for You!",
				"View Quoted Comment Wow Amber, I had no idea! Everyone's body is so different, which is really why everyone should consult their doctor and definitely sort this out months before their wedding.",
				"View Quoted Comment Depo was my first instance with hormonal bc and I ended up having cycles for two weeks, then none for two months and it would repeat. Not to mention I gained 30 pounds and a few cup sizes. I would never recommend depo because it took two years for me to get pregnant after with only two shots. If you plan on getting pregnant after the wedding, Do NOT go with Depo",
				"View Quoted Comment That is a good point. Do not use hormone BC in general if you ware planning to try and conceive ASAP!",
				"View Quoted Comment Sorry that happened to you! I've never been on depo but I heard horror stories about it when I was a teen, weight gain mostly. I've heard some people love it and some people hate it. Studies have also shown that it can take up to 12 months for hormonal BC to leave your system completely, and my guess is probably longer if it's a concentration of the hormones (like the depo shot). I think for me it took about 6 months when I got off the pill. I wasn't trying to get pregnant, nor did I get pregnant, but I just felt \"normal\" again at about 6 months. BC is not something to take lightly by any means and everyone's body is so different it's hard to know before using it what your body will do.",
				"View Quoted Comment Always copper IUD with no hormones. And there is no evidence any thing you mentioned work at all. But they won't hurt!",
				"Love this positivity! It\u2019s exactly what I needed lol! My period is forecasted to start on my wedding day in 9 days. My periods are never really that bad with cramps and bloating. It just sucks because we wanted to baby dance during the honeymoon haha It\u2019s okay though! We\u2019ll still be healthy and happy and we can start trying when we get home haha",
				"View Quoted Comment Yeah, mine was the copper IUD because I was trying to get away from the hormones. And yeah, there is no full proof causational evidence for the options because the female body is far too understudied in the medical industry, but there are studies that show correlation and some science behind some of them, like the exercise and weight loss and sex. Others are more \"wives tails\" and eastern medicine. It's worth a shot I think",
				"I'm a doctor who has a special interest in reproductive health and the majority of what I do all day is counsel people on contraception. Trying things like ginger and vinegar is fine but there is no science behind it but benign so give it a try.If you want unbiased info on contraception https://www.bedsider.org is a great source.As I tell all of my patients, if you are having sex and not using any protection YOU ARE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT. You may ovulate/be fertile 14 days from when you get your period, but sperm can last for 7 days, some even say 10! If you do not want to get pregnant, please use condoms if you are not on some form of birth control! Or you have to be very very diligent with natural family planning methods like taking your temperature. I agree there are lots of side effects to these medications and devices, for a better term. And trying to weigh the pluses and minuses are really key and takes time and being on the wrong thing can definitely change your mind and body. SOME TIPS- form a good relationship with your doctor. If you dont like them, find another-for PMS symptoms, exercise can help with symptoms. Midol is just tylenol and caffeine. Medications like naproxen have been shown to work much better for PMS, but you need to start taking them the week before your period on a consistent basis, this decreases the chemicals that contribute to bloating, inflammation, and cramps. -there is no one size fits all hormonal birth control. but thankfully there are a ton of options! Again. the link above. -totally safe to take birth control pills or use patch/ring and not allow youself to have your period. Women had been doing this for a long time and now there are pills sold like this as well-depo's major side effect is spotting and irregular bleeding, so beware. It works great but maybe not the best \"I'm going on my honeymoon option\" -None of these options but an IUD work instantly! They all take time, so again getting depo or starting pills (unless very well timed) right before your honeymoon doesnt prevent you from getting pregnant. - People forget about progesterone only pills, often called mini pill. They are underused but work well, you just have to take them the same time everyday. -the copper IUD is also often forgotten, it doesnt have the nice side effects of a hormonal one like small or on periods but it prevents pregnancy well-IUDs have the least effect on the time to wait to be able to get pregnant after removal vs pills, etc. But I know it isnt for everyone. If you haven't had kid and are thinking about one, then you should schedule placement when you are on your period to help. Sometimes your doctor can give you medicine to help your cervix open up too. Also make sure they place IUDs regularly, like once a day. I will say almost every female doctor I know has an IUD and I work at a large medical institution. But again not for everyone and I get that!I would also highlight that if you care at all about any of these of these issues, PLEASE VOTE in your local, state and federal elections! Women health care is at severe risk of being destroyed and undermined by current political powers. Pregnancy was pre-existing conditions before the American Care Act, so you could be denied or pay higher health insurance if you had been pregnant before! WHAT!?! Insurance companies and employers did not have to pay for birth control before, I remember my mom paying $75 a month for birth control pills! Insurance companies now cover breast pumps and other women wellness exams thanks to ACA and that is being threatened too! Vote!",
				"Thankssssss for posting this! I can never comment on other people\u2019s period posts because my advice would be \u201cwhy does it matter? Just have sex anyways.

				"This is still one of my fears! Right now it should end before we leave for Vegas because I've been on the mark with the app when it says it's coming. Until today.

It was enough to keep me up all night and land me in urgent care the next morning because I was 99% sure it was strep.It wasn't, but I so wish it was.It was a cold, I took cold meds and started feeling better, but now I think it's developed into bronchitis because my chest is completely congested and I've been coughing like crazy I told my mom if I'm not feeling any better by this weekend, I'm going back to the doc to make sure I'm NOT SICK on my wedding day! I've been taking Mucinex to help with the cough and congestion. It's helping slightly, at least bring the cough down a bit, but any ideas to help with the congestion? I read online coffee actually helps open everything up because it's a stimulant, which is cool cause I'm drinking coffee at work anyway.

Boil some water in a large pot, turn the flame off and hold your head over the pot draped with a towel over your head so the steam can loosen any phlegm. If you have any eucalyptus essential oil, put a few drops in the water in the pot. Avoid dairy. Echinacea at this point is useless, don\u2019t waste your money.",

Keep a humidifier on as well. Zarbee's is also a great natural cough syrup. An older folk has told me to buy an Aloe plant, cut a size that will fit under your foot, slice it in half and warm it to a tolerable level for your skin. Put it under your feet at bedtime and put socks on. Old school remedy LOL",

				"View Quoted Comment Lemon water has SO MANY benefits besides boosting your immune system. It helps boost energy, metabolism, it's good for your skin nails and hair, and it helps with weight loss! I use to drink it every morning for well over a year and have fallen off the wagon. I should get back into it......",
				"Look up about apple cider vinegar. It tastes gross, but it works! I usually use a tsp of it in a small glass of water then add in a bit of honey. I do it twice a day for 2-3 days and it alleviates everything so well for me. Good luck!"

It\u2019s Whole Foods only for 30 days, and it\u2019s rough at first, but helps you kick your cravings for sweets and fast food (fast food was my issue). It also gets you into a routine of fixing your own foods to have on hand when you have a late night craving.",

				"View Quoted Comment My wedding is 2020 as well. I started working out four times a week and drinking water! Drink lots and lots of water, it helps curve cravings of wanting to grab something sweet. You can do it! Try not to eat any big meals after 6 PM as your metabolism slows down after that time. My manager also suggested start counting your carbs an sugars that you already eat now daily and cut that in half if you can. Good luck!",
				"My FH and I significantly cut sugar earlier this year and try carb alternatives where we can. We also stopped eating out so much. It took a few months for my body to figure it out even though I missed it but I finally saw progress in the 3rd month. I also have kept a food journal all year and used MyFitnessPal to track how much sugar and carbs I'm consuming and it has helped me make smart decisions.",
				"Start tracking what you eat. Increase the fiber (get 25 grams a day), increase the water (.5 oz of water per 1 lb you weigh), lower the sugar (keep under 25 grams a day), and be more active (walk, yoga, pilates, weights, whatever you fancy).I've been using MyFitnessPal religiously to log, and I have been following advice from nutritionists that emphasize getting protein (20g per meal), fat (1 tablespoon), & fiber (1/4 of your plate of complex carbs and 1/2 your plate of non-starchy veggies). It does wonders when you start eating this way, because it really does fill you up and sustains you, so you are crashing and craving later. I've been following both Kelly Leveque's \"Fab Four\" plan and Tanya Zuckerbrot's \"F Factor\" diet together. I am telling you, I have never been so happy with the results and have finally found freedom from my sugar addiction. The advice from these two ladies just works, because it's science based. And once you know the science, you finally do break free of the food drama.Feel free to follow me on MyFitnessPal, blb85 is my screenname.",

I realize some of that is water weight and won't keep up that pace every week, but it feels good to have success when you're starting out. Aside from the weight loss which is encouraging, I have to say I'm way more satisfied with what I'm eating now than I was when I was just tracking calories and struggling to lose 1/2 a pound in a week even with exercising most days. The food I was eating didn't change my cravings because it was unsatisfying and I cheated often. I have not had cheating guilt once over the last week because I haven't wanted to cheat! I thought giving up carbs like bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, etc would be way harder than it has been. I really don't even miss them when I get to eat a ton of other things I really like. I'm a little nervous about going out of town this weekend since I've been able to have such control over my food at home, but I just have to remember all of my research and do the best I can eating out and keep it simple with my choices, eggs and bacon at breakfast, burger no bun or condiments, bring my own snacks, etc.",

I can lose 2 pounds 1 week and then gain them back the next and this has been going on the past 6 months while exercising 3-4 times a week with a mix of cardio and weight training. Sometimes not every diet works for everyone. I see the success stories everywhere except in the mirror. I am now going to attempt carnivore, which doesn't allow any carbs even from plants/vegetables, only meat and dairy. It's been a long hard road up to this point, and to think I started back in December to have plenty of time to lose the weight before my wedding this September... and I have plenty to lose."

I'm having her tear out the zipper and install a corset. Dress insurance. I do not need to be stressing out the week of my wedding, hoping I will fit. Ain't nobody got time for that.",
				"I ordered the sample size because it fit me perfectly. I also had spanx on when I tried it on. When my dress came in, it wouldn't zip up, and I was devastated. I realized I wasn't wearing spanx when I picked it up. I can't really wear any with the way the dress is low in the back, so I have been working out and changed my diet. I lost 5 pounds and my dress fits me perfectly now without any undergarments. I use Sparkpeople to track my food and fitness. I have my own diet - no red meat, low intake of bread, rice, and pasta. More veggies and more water! You could always talk to a seamstress. Good luck!",
				"Well water retention is a huge possibility (your body holds it because there's not enough new water coming in). If you're eating a lot of salt, it will dehydrate you and make you look bigger than you are. If that is the reason, drink a lot more water, eat a SERIOUS amount of fruit like there's no tomorrow (before any cooked food), and drastically reduce your sodium. You may need to get used to it and allow your taste buds to adjust. ETA: I'm pretty sure stress can cause swelling and inflammation. De-stress with yoga and and take organic turmeric daily!! I know fat weighs more than muscle lb for lb, so if you're losing muscle and gaining fat at the same time that makes sense... However isn't it in your torso that your dress won't button? How much muscle could the average woman have on their torso?ETA: oh my diet suggestion is The Starch Solution combined with Raw til 4! xD",

				"Focus on triceps, so dips, tricep kickbacks, triceps extensions, and push-ups. The triceps are the muscles that tone the bottom of your arms, so you lose the chicken wing effect!",
				"Adding muscle will not make you look bigger. Weights will give you what you want. A more defined look. I would look on Pinterest to get started and start with 5 pound weights.",

Muscle will only make your arms look bigger if you add muscle and do not lose any fat. So as long as you continue dieting and exercising you will be fine.Heavier weights will give you the \"toned\" arms you want. No - they wont make you look manly. It takes a lot of effort to get \"manly\" arms and no one gets arms like that on accident. For exercises - compound barbell movements will give you the most bang for your buck. Do bench press, over head shoulder press & bent over barbell rows. Then add in accessory work such as shoulder press, lateral raises (front and side), rear delt flys, bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, skull crushers.... theres a lot you can do! Do not be afraid to go heavy!! Do a mixture of low rep, high weight days and high rep low weight days.",

If you want to lose mass in your arms and build muscle, you\u2019ll need to do a mixture of eating in a caloric deficit, cardiovascular exercise, and weight training. For toning up your arms, start with low weights or body weights. If you search Pinterest, you\u2019ll probably find multiple routines or exercises to help tone your arms. Pushups (wide, normal, and narrow triangle hands) are always good. Try doing exercises that focus on your biceps, triceps, shoulder, chest, and upper back. Tricep exercises will get rid of the \u201cbat wing\u201d effect some people have but you should try to work out all areas of your upper body. I work out pretty regularly, 5-6 times per week. For upper body, I will do one day of chest and tricep exercises, one day of back, biceps, and shoulder exercises, and one day of yoga (YouTube) that focuses on upper body. Your dress is very pretty btw!",

You each do 1, then 2, all the way up to 8 and back down to 1. You end up doing 64 total, but its more fun that way.",

I can not say for sure since I do not know what condition your tooth is in. I have not seen a snap on smile that looks good. You risk making the rest of your teeth look artificial trying to hide just one. If your dentist does good cosmetic work the temporary bridge will look much better than a snap on smile. No one will know it\u2019s not the final if done right. Seek help of a dentist as soon as possible if you want the best results. Plus it will be moving you in the right direction long term. The \u201csnap on smile\u201d will be getting you no where in terms of improving your teeth. It\u2019s just a mask. But if you do try it please show us the pictures of what they look like.",

I'm sure it's a case of \"if the price is too good to be true, it probably is\" situations. I completely understand wanting to feel confident about your smile (before my surgery my teeth were super crooked and sometimes I got lucky with camera angles so they didn't look awful, but most of the time i was super self-conscious."

				"This depends on so many things. I once dropped two sizes without losing any weight, because I started doing more weight training or using body weight during workouts instead of just cardio. If you care about size, pounds are not the right way to measure it. Start working out 4-5 times a week, 30+ minutes each time. Cut out sweets and other sugary stuff. Eat fruits and vegetables. Don't eat very much of whatever you do eat, just enough to fill you up. And stay off the scale, it won't help you.",

Weight training is great because will help you burn fat at a higher rate, or at least that\u2019s how it works for me. If you need healthy cooking recipes, try out Pinterest. They have soooo many easy, healthy recipes. Invest in a spiralizer! It\u2019s such a fun way to increase your veggie intake. Take care of yourself and try not to stress because that can reverse the effects of weight loss. Also, I think you mentioned you would look at increasing the number of days you work out. If you do that, try not to focus on the numbers on the scale. See how the fit of your clothes feel. As you work out more, you will probably begin to gain more muscle. Muscle weighs more than fact so it is possible you can drop to your desired dress size without losing that many pounds.",
				"View Quoted Comment I agree with all of this! I'm 5'3 and 145 lbs but I wear a size 2. Sometimes a 0 depending on my butt.

I don't have a sweet tooth so soda and desserts have never been a part of my diet. FH has stomach issues so we stick to whole foods so for dinner we usually have a meat option and two veggie options.

FH and I decided to cut out alcohol unless it's the weekend but even then we don't have it in the house. It has helped tremendously with keeping the pounds off! But keep in mind that wedding dresses have very different sizing than normal clothes. Normal clothes I'm a 0-2. My wedding dress is a size 8.",
				"This is still a little confusing to me. Do you already own your dress in a size 6? Or, have you tried it on in a size 6? Are you limited to the availability in only a size 6, so now you \"have to fit\" into it? If so, can it be altered? (Most size sixes should be easily altered to fit a size 8.)But, it also sounds like perhaps you don't have your dress yet, and are considering a somewhat random goal. Honestly, a \"clothing size\" is completely arbitrary. (Unless you are planning on wearing the size tag on the outside, no one will ever know the size of your dress....) As pps have described, depending on the manufacturer, your same sized body might be a different (arbitrary) size in every dress you try on. (And, samples are notorious for being very stretched out, so a size 6 sample you try on might actually be closer to a size 8 or 10's measurements [especially in the waist].) If I followed the thread, I think you've reported that you are 5'5\" and weight 125; that's a very healthy weight with a BMI of less than 21. Good luck, but based on your thread, I'd just encourage you to think about your reasons for wanting to be smaller, and the pros and cons of your plan.",
				"You truly can\u2019t go by pounds when it comes to dropping \u201csizes\u201d. You can lose inches and not have much weight come off depending on what type of eating and weight training/exercise your doing. Focus on eating clean and getting exercise daily. Water intake is very important, you are supposed to drink half of your weight daily in ounces.",
				"Why not order the dress in your current size? The added pressure to drop the weight is no fun!",

At first I was all about the pounds as well, until I realized that even though I\u2019m losing inches, I wasn\u2019t losing so many pounds. Muscle weighs more than fat, so losing the inches is the goal! I swim laps Monday-Thursday for an hour, get home and do pilates for 30 minutes, alternating which muscle group I focus on (abs, arms, legs, glutes). Friday I go to ultimate frisbee for 2hrs. Breakfast is black coffee and something small- eggs, etc. Lunch is a slim fast or egg whites, and dinner is a prepared meal I have delivered under 400 calories. I\u2019ve been having liver issues so I\u2019ve had to cut A LOT out of my diet by medical necessity (including alcohol, which sucked until I realized how many calories I was consuming) so that\u2019s been helping a lot.

Maybe see if you can find a dress that looks good with your natural lovely pale skin before worrying about tanning too much? Otherwise, please do it in a safe way like a spray tan. Natural tanning is really dangerous, especially for pale people! I got my paleness from my mom and she got burned a lot when she was younger, and now she has lots of little skin cancers all over. She has to put cream on them and is supposed to stay out of the sun while she is using the cream. Luckily she doesn\u2019t have the really bad kind of skin cancer that kills people though!",
				"If I go outside at dusk I glow I am so white. I don't tan. Literally spent 10 days in Hawaii last month and still just as white as when I left. Personally I will be staying glow in the dark for my wedding. However, you have time to trial spray tans and see what you like and if you can find a good one.",
				"Try out a spray tan. I've gotten one a few times and loved it. I plan to do one before the wedding, I wouldn't use a tanning bed due to the harmful effects. My friend who got married last year tanned way too much in a bed and she looked very orange.",
				"You look gorgeous! I wouldn\u2019t suggest tanning, even spray. I think all brides are beautiful, tan or not. But when I see a tan bride it\u2019s usually because she\u2019s normally tan, and why would she be any different on her wedding day? I think non tanned skin can look very bridal. One of my cousins was working on decreasing her tan (she had been tanning for years and decided she was over it) before the wedding. Ultimately it\u2019s personal preference. If you\u2019re dead set on being tan, test how the spray tan looks on you long before the wedding. Drastically changing your look before a big event is a huge risk.",
				"Honestly, you have lovely skin. Please don\u2019t tan in a bed to achieve this glow you desire. I used to be obsessed with tanning beds, and worked at a tanning salon for over a year (free tanning=bad). My skin definitely looked much older on my 19 year old face. I stopped tanning when I turned 22 and my skin looks so much younger now. It\u2019s better in the long run to embrace your porcelain skin than to be tan for your wedding. It\u2019s simply not worth it.if you really want to get some color, consider mystic tanning or versa spray tanning. Both are way safer options. I will be pale for my wedding in a few weeks and I\u2019m not even worried about it.",
				"I'm a pale redhead and considered spray tanning for the wedding (I would never consider a tanning bed for the skin cancer implications). A good friend of mine did a high end spray tan a few days before and the inside of her dress was still orange after her reception because it was so humid. I decided to forego it and if I tanned a little naturally, that would suffice. I didn't, and it turned out fine. The white dress didn't wash me out and I looked like me.",
				"I have the same problem, I see pictures of really tan instagram models in their wedding dresses and think \"yes I must be tan!\" but don't want to damage my skin in a tanning bed, I'd probably only burn anyway, and I've heard that going just once increases your risk of getting skin cancer by 75% (don't quote me on that, I don't have a reference)!Anyway, I've had decent results with Jergen's in the past, but I'm not sure if I'm going to do that because sometimes I mess up and have streaks, not something I want to risk for wedding pictures, and also I'm worried it'll rub off on my snow-white dress! Same problem with spray tanning.I think my plan is just going to be to try and get as much of a natural tan as I can throughout the summer, luckily my wedding is in August so if I make an effort to get outside, I won't necessarily be my wintery-pale self. One other option is to discuss your concerns with your photographer - they may be able to use some lighting tricks or lenses to make you look tanner",
				"I think your skin is beautiful. My daughter the bride also has porcelain skin. I tell her to watch Kate Winslet in Titanic. Your makeup artist can add some subtle color with blushes and bronzers. I wouldn't tan or use self tanner."

I would wait a few months to try it on again and not start alterations until closer to the wedding.",

You can take it to a seamstress now to see how much wiggle room she thinks there is in letting out the seams, whether converting to a corset back is an option, or if there is anything else she recommends. I would wait to begin any work on the dress, though, until you're only 2-3 months out from your wedding.

Maybe a bit snug bit it's strapless so I liked it. Well I ended up buying a new belt for it so tried it all on the other day. I can't get it to zip up! I'm horrified. I've never had weight issues and am usually around 120-125. I never weigh myself. I don't have a scale. I weighed myself two weeks ago at my mom's while I was using her bathroom and I was 130. Which isn't totally unusual for me but heavier. So now that the dress doesn't zip up I'm like oh grap. My jeans still fit fine but I have noticed my bras feel a bit tighter. I've been working out more (pole dance classes, which I highly recommend so much fun) and I think it's because of my back muscles !!! So I've stopped working out. What else can I do? Maybe running ? I don't know if that will help my back tho? I have about 4 inches left to zip up.",

But I even tried just closing the pieces of fabric and they didn't meet. Yikes. The woman who took my dress in had it done in 1 week. But i would hate to go back and make her redo it. Plus, now she's taking it out and I'm not sure if that can be done or not.",
				"I say seamstress!! Maybe see if somebody else can get it zipped up since you said you had a hard time yourself and see where the issue is. As far as your weight goes, muscle weighs more than fat. So please understand that it's not fat and it's going to be hard to just lose it too.",

Use it as your motivation. Don't start altering your dress yet. It is way too early for that. Remember it is like 80% diet so watch the decisions in the kitchen. Start reading labels and watch carbs is the best advice I can give. I have been working on this for 6 months and it is a real eye opener. My doctor told me to eat under 50 carbs a day and you don't realize how many carbs are in everything!!! I used to eat easily 200 a day. While I slack getting to the gym, I feel better and have been losing weight. It took a while to adjust to my new diet but it is one of the best decisions I have ever made.",

Working out 7 days a week can be counter-productive. Also, eating clean is great but watch out for your caloric intake as well.

As far as eating pretty decent, if you want results eating clean is more important than the work outs. Tracking your calories on myfitnesspal is helpful, just make sure your doing a proper daily calorie count, too little calories a day & working out that much is not healthy or worth it for going out to eat meals: try Calorie Cap - they have popular restaurants on there and tell you what you can eat within your calorie restrictions As far as motivation, i just think if I'm gonna look MY absolutely best at any time in my life now is the time, and that usually gets my butt motivated. *my best* being the key words there, remember no matter if you loose only 3.3 or 30 it's not gonna affect how you look on your wedding day, i understand the desire to look your best, but its your wedding! you will look amazing no matter what.",

Start running, do a lot of cardio. If you want to exercise seven days a week, I would advise high-intensity five days a week (at least 60-90 minutes), then take a long walk and relax a little the other two days. Don't worry about lifting weights, you'll just build muscle under fat and appear bigger. If you do a lot of cardio now and lose the weight you want, then you can start worrying about weights and toning. Good luck!",

Last summer I was in ehh shape and 127 lbs (at 5'9). Now I take kickboxing and I have decent muscle tone, worlds better than last year and I'm around 137 lbs. And my measurements haven't changed. So weight # is a grain of salt type of thing",
				"I recommend looking into myfitnesspal. It's a site used for counting calories. You input your information and it will tell you how many calories you should eat a day. There's also forums there if you need help. Your weight loss is going good so far! Good job!",
				"You will lose the most weight by watching your diet. Eat whole foods, more protein and veggies, and literally no processed foods especially carb heavy ones. I am part of a medical weight loss clinic (through a hospital with a board certified M.D. as the lead) and we are advised to basically eat 100g of carbs per day, and no more than 20 carbs per meal. That means all of our carbs come from veggies. I still get carbs in my diet so its not traditional Atkins or keto or anything, but its more so focused on whole foods and quality carbs. I've lost about 40lbs so far, and I am 5'1\" as well. I have a lot of weight to lose so this was my last resort before I would consider weight loss surgery. Its doable. Just make sure to eat at home, and focus your efforts on eating well. The exercise has benefits outside of weight loss, but the weight loss will be mostly achieved through diet. Good luck.",
				"Diet is 80% and working out is 20% when it comes to losing weight... working out is good and needed for our bodies. But as others have mentioned, for the best results changing your diet and staying away from processed foods and sugars will give you the best results!!",
				"Water. Water. Water and try to exercise as least 30 mins, 5 days a week.",
				"Whoever above said that weight lifting will make you appear bigger is wrong. The ONLY way you will appear bigger by weight lifting is if you're eating in a surplus. It doesn't sound to me like you are, so I'd definitely try incorporating some weight lifting into your plan as well.Weight lifting, contrary to popular belief, does not just bulk you up. You actually have to try really, really hard and purposefully to do so. In your case, weight lifting will help you tone and strength your muscles, which will in turn provide you with better quality workouts and will help you burn more calories. Even just incorporating one upper body day and one lower body day a week will help you out. Weight lifting will also help you improve your cardio, HIIT, and barre workouts; you'll be stronger and therefore more able to sustain power and strength during these workouts.",
				"I also wanted to add that losing 30 lbs and being only at 150 may not be the healthiest choice for your body. You should talk to a dietician, personal trainer, or doctor and determine if that is reasonably feasible and healthy for you. I'm 5'2\" and my goal weight is 150, I can't even imagine being 120 (nothing wrong for those who are!), but that is my body type. I agree, watching size is body shape is much more important than the number on the scale. You may slim up significantly while staying the same weight, especially with weight lifting and Pure Barre because of increased muscle. Good luck! And you will look beautiful no matter what!",
				"I love barre classes! I think you are definitely on the right track",
				"Exercise and eating well is great!! Have you used or tried any supplements? Cleanses or greens?",
				"I'm doing the keto diet and have had fabulous results. It is a little demanding as far as time and you have to be pretty disciplined, but it has worked for FH and I. Just make sure you do a lot of research so you are following it properly and stay healthy.",
				"Cardio and clean eating are essential for health but the thing you are missing in strength training/weights. Muscles burn more calories than fat does so you might need to build up some muscle. Also strength training can help you tone and slide off those few extra pounds.",
				"I do plexus, and I've already lost 15lbs in 2 months, and I'm so happy with it. I can help you get more info from my lady I use if you would like... that's what I've been doing between that and working out."

			"title": "NWR: Ovarian cysts and MRI+Update",
			"content": "Hi all. I know I've made another post about a medical thing recently, but I have a couple things going on. I was recently diagnosed with Ovarian cysts via ultrasound. One on each ovary about 5cm. They think that one is hemmorhagic or endometrioma (that's the one that hurts) and the other is bilateral with solid material and what they think is a small benign tumor . I'm having my MRI today with follow up with doctor tomorrow. I know it's highly unlikely that it's cancer because of my age but I'm still so nervous. (ETA: for many years people/Drs have dismissed my pain as me being a hypochondriac or normal period pain, and finally a PA listened to me and said we should get it looked at and then found this...) Has anyone dealt with something similar before?",
			"comments": [
				"Yup, I'm in the ovarian cyst club! I keep begging to have my entire reproductive system removed. So far, no luck. I'm sorry that yours led to a tumor though.",
				"Yep. I've never had one removed, but I get them if I don't take my bc. I also have been on bc for 14 years to control my cysts. They where the most painful thing I have experiemced thus far in my life.",
				"I have ovarian cysts as well. Mine tend to burst though, which causes me extreme pain I was placed on a birth control that actually prevents me from ovulating (which is what causes them to form). That could be something to help?",
				"I've actually been on birth control for a long time. There was a brief 1-2 month period where I wasn't on it and it was during the appointment to get new birth control that I brought up the symptoms again to this newer obgyn office. Can tumors grow that quickly? I think I must've had this for a while because a lot of symptoms I've felt in years past. Not constant, but the pain pops up here and there.",
				"I am so glad you finally got some answers. I have endometriosis and I know the struggle of not feeling good, being dismissed and then they realize oh what something isnt right. You know your body best! I will be praying for you!",
				"I've had them, but mine burst. Unfortunately once that happens and they do the interior ultrasound (in sure there's a more medical way to describe that ultrasound method), there's only fluid left and no cysts. They hurt like a bitch, so I can't imagine all the pain you might be in. Not at all the same, by my aunt had fibroids and was able to have them removed (and be in less pain) and also carry a baby to nearly full term. He's eight now, so just something positive! Best of luck, thoughts and prayers your way!",
				"I haven't dealt with this issue, I have dealt with some other cervical problems, but I just wanted to wish you best of luck today! You will get through this and hopefully they will find a solution for you.",
				"I'm like Ariana. I have endo but it took a while for any treatment to start because my Dr thought it was normal period pain. He prescribed me pain killers which used to help but after a while it just got too bad so he said he thought it was endo and he did a laparoscopy and burned it all out. He also inserted the Mirena IUD which seems to be helping keep the endo away.",
				"Thank you for the well wishes. At least I've finally figured out something and am taking steps! I have the consultation with the obgyn tomorrow morning so I'll post an update...",
				"Yes. Throughout my teens and into early 30's. It was miss diagnosed a few times as appendicitis and was even discussing surgery in the ER when another doctor took a look/gave his opinion. That's when I found out I had cysts. I went to a few doctors and one \"highly recommend\" I have a hysterectomy. Thank God I kept searching. I have 2 awesome kids. So frustrating, so very very painful, and I felt so dismissed by the medical community. When I found a doctor who listened and took the time to thoroughly exam me, using every tool available to him, I stuck with him. I am so sorry you are dealing with this. You are in my thoughts today. Best wishes Rae. BTW, my cysts completely disappeared after my first pregnancy. ???",
				"I have really bad cysts. I have the nexplanon implant and I'm on oral birth control to try to manage my cysts. I'm very worried they are going to make getting pregnant very hard. Don't stress about it! It only makes it worse..",
				"Jennifer, I could feel/tell when they burst too. It was absolutely crazy.",
				"@Nancy, yeah I'm concerned about being able to get pregnant too. I'm not even looking to soon but what's happening is discouraging. I'm hoping for a solution so that it can still be possible in a few years.",
				"@Kathleen yeah, it's amazing how dismissed these issues are! When I did more research on cysts, they can cause so many abdominal issues and I'm wondering if other pains I've felt are side effects of these!",
				"Yes & how between endo/obgyn/gp it is like a weird shared responsibility. They really have to all work together. Not sure how mine compare to yours but my OBGYN said not to worry about getting pregnant and maintaining a healthy lifestyle & weight is your most important job regarding this. You don't look like you have any issue w this but she said even 5-10lbs over a healthy weight makes a huge difference.",
				"I'm so sorry you're going through this and it makes me so angry. I experience the same issues with doctors dismissing my concerns and I'm losing my mind over it. About seven years ago I found a grape size lump in my breast. I had a mammogram and biopsy. It's a fibroadenoma, but I have more that I've found since then and they are very painful. No doctor since has felt it necessary for me to have a mammogram because of my age and they won't approve it for insurance even though I've requested. I'm terrified that more could be wrong and my grandmother did have breast cancer but try getting a doctor to care...",
				"I've had cysts on my ovaries since I was 15. Sometimes the pain I experience is so bad I have to stop what I'm doing and sit or find a couch to crash on. I wouldn't worry too much until you know something. Birth control pills have definitely helped keep my cysts small so that may be an option for you.",
				"Wow, I was scrolling on my newsfeed and Buzzfeed released this very timely video \"Times My Doctors Didn't Listen to my Pain.\" Most of the women had gynecological problems. https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedVideo/videos/2308612209279648/",
				"I've had TERRIBLE period pain since I was 16. I always had the feeling something was wrong but no one ever really looked into it. Earlier this year I got pregnant and they found a cyst while doing my ultrasound. I'm not really sure if the two things are related but it wouldn't surprise me. Anyway, I didn't have a hard time getting pregnant (we weren't trying) and I have not had any complications because of it - I can't even feel it. My doctor said a lot of times they'll go away on their own but I'm very glad your doctors have an eye on it and you'll be getting some answers!",
				"Yes. I had ovarian cysts when I was in my early 20's. One day, they all burst. That wasn't fun.",
				"I am so sorry you are going through this. I now have cysts as a result of my infection/emergency surgery. I had the mirena (IUD) and it bridged an infection into my cervix causing PID. It went untreated for 3 months, and I even went to the ER because I hadn't had a bowel movement in two weeks. They did a CT scan and told me it was viral, take a laxative and sent me home. Two days later, I couldn't walk and had a bright red hot spot on my lower abdomen. Back to the ER, and they found a 6cm by 4cm mass on my right ovary. It was not cancerous but actually an absest from the infection. If I had waited 3 more hours, I would have gone septic (the mass was why I wasnt having a bowel movement as it blocked my small intestine). I now have scarring and they had to remove one of my tubes. Luckily, my cysts have burst each month so far, but it is extremely painful. I knew something was wrong and I didn't speak up. I now only have one tube and have scarring all over my entire system, which adds to the cysts. I really hope you can get some answers and help with dealing with them. Make sure you keep asking every question you think of even if you think \"it dumb\". I wish I had done that. They are very painful. God speed to you!",
				"Uterine fibroids run in my family and I've already been diagnosed with them but mine aren't bad enough to need surgery thank goodness. I take bc pills and that helps keep them at bay for now but it's only a matter of time - literally every woman on my mom's side of the family has them bad. I feel for all you women out there with lady time troubles",
				"I had pelvic pain for MONTHS until back in May they found cysts on each of my ovaries. Mine rupture and twist, it's horrible. I have opted out of hormone therapy and just stick to regular birth control because of the side effects of the hormone therapy. Good luck! I'll keep you in my thoughts.@JGCT do you mean a transvaginal ultrasound?",
				"I had one massive ovarian cyst removed two years ago. It weighed 10 pounds and contained 4 liters of fluid. It was incredibly scary but like they told you, not likely cancerous because of my age. A blood test CA 125 also confirmed this before the surgery, and afterwords all my pathology reports were negative for malignant cells. I lost an ovary in the process but it all turned out okay- I am still able to have kids in the future and have no lasting effects. Sending all the positive vibes your way! You'll get through this!!",
				"Hi all thanks a lot for your well wishes. My MRI results still haven't come in yet but the doctor is pretty sure it's endometriosis based on all of my symptoms and I'll definitely have to have surgery in the coming weeks to remove both of the large cysts and endometriosis. She said that we won't know if we need to do more testing on the tumor until I get my MRI back. I've been anxious all weekend. .",
				"Yes, they found a 2cm ovarian cyst at the time I was diagnosed with PCOS. It doubled in size in a three month time period and was causing lots of pain, so my gynecologist insisted on an MRI to get more info about the cyst (mainly, what material was it filled with). The results showed it was likely filled with blood and was benign. Over the next three months, I suspect it continued to grow, as the pain got worse. At that time, I was flying home from grad school to visit my parents and see my doctor. They were talking about removing it surgically. The day I flew home I was in so much pain, I could not even walk through the airport (thank goodness for moving sidewalks in airports!). I felt like someone was using my lower abdomen as a washcloth and was wringing me out, or like someone had put a pole through me and was roasting me on a spit. After I got home, I went for an ultrasound and there was no more cyst. It had burst and I hadn't realized that's what was happening while I was in the airport. I had started taking hormonal birth control to regulate my period for the PCOS, and I have only had one small cyst since. Occasionally I go through periods where I have random abdominal pains that don't necessarily coincide with my menstrual cycle, but nothing like what I experienced from that one cyst. I hope you get good results back and that the MRI provides your doctor with useful information in diagnosing you and coming up with solutions for you.",
				"Hi OP. I feel for you! I was diagnosed with endometriosis when I was only 19. I have had numerous surgeries to take care of it. During one of the surgeries, they found both my ovaries were loaded with cysts. I still occasionally get them and they rupture on their own. Luckily my endo has resolved itself. It was a long road but aside from the random occasional cyst, I am okay now at 33. Good luck! You'll feel better immediately if they do take your cysts out.",
				"Well, got my results back and apparently they think the cysts burst, which would explain a great deal of pain I had! But the MRI didn't show anything concerning anymore, so I guess I'm in the clear. They're still going to do a follow up ultrasound in a couple months, but at least I don't need surgery atm.",
				"My mom had bad cysts when she was younger and had to have an ovary removed. Doctors told her it would be hard to get pregnant again after that but she had 5 more kids in an 8 year span. Not sure if that helps, but I hope everything goes well for you!",
				"Yes! Endometriosis is horrible. I read somewhere hat it's sometimes considered one of the top ten most painful diseases. I dealt with pain for 6 years before a doctor even mentioned endometriosis. And we're supposed to trust these \"medical professionals\"",
				"I have them as well, one of both side. They also kept dismissing me but I have other issues as well and while searching for those they were finally found. I have pain in my right on and the doctors have told me they wont remove them because they have not gotten large enough. I think one is 3cm and the other is 6cm. I actually think I'm pregnant right now but I'm waiting to take a test here is a few days. I don't think they cause too much issues with me at least. They said that it was caused by an egg not being released at ovulations and just continuing to build. I got conflicting advice from different doctors though.",
				"I thought I had a cyst but it was a tumor on my ovary. It doubled in size from June to October (2.5 to 5 cm) it was benign and removed along with my ovary. Since it's been removed I've felt much better!",
				"I've been down that road. I had a cyst on my left ovary and they think I may have endometriosis. At the time, my doctor put me on birth control to help relive any pain and abnormal periods. I've recently come off the bc this past June. So far I haven't had any problems, but I'm just hoping it doesn't cause me anymore pain.",
				"In May I just had major stomach surgery to remove fibroids and such, and lord have mercy, I had started swelling and couldn't fit into my dress, in July when I went to my alterations appointment, I lost 2 dress sizes, so now I needed a new dress, it wasn't in stock and had to be ordered. Long story short, new dress was delivered in August and the only alterations I needed was the bustle installed, I will keep you in my prayers, good luck!"

I would have never been noticed this on somebody and am still sorta confused what the issue is. Just looks like normal hips to me. I'm sure you look amazing in your dress.",

I am just focusing on doing exercises to build muscle in that dipping area.. leg lifts out to the side and on all fours like you are a dog peeing on a fire hydrant haha.

While I totally love and appreciate a good piece of shapewear and wore some on my wedding day, only wear the shapewear because they make you feel confident and comfortable, not because your dress shows off your natural shape. Hips have curves, and \"hip dips\" are just the flavor of the month. I'd love to see a pic of you in the dress you chose, I bet you rock it.",

As far as the hip dips goes, I agree with PP that this isn't something anyone else notices (or knows what it is).",

I find any normal shapewear that goes down to your thighs (basically anything that isnt a bikini brief cut but more of a boy short or long) is fine. ETA_ Also both OGA and Olivia are correct. Violin hips or hip dips are apart of your bone structure/body structure. No amount of weighloss will get ride of them. I had them at my heaviest weight and at my lowest (100 lbs). I still have them now that I am inbetween that. I have friends who are personal trainers with tons of muscle you have them. THey aren't anything to be ashamed of, but I alwways fear people will think they look like a panty line so I wear shapewear!",

Also, it seems like a new body shaming technique that is a more recent obsession based on article dates. I remember in high school, a larger girl poked me jokingly and happened to hit my hip bone and then tried to shame me for them being prominent and not covered in fat. No. I shut that down right away. I was a state ranked track runner at the time and very healthy. Just because someone else doesn't have the same body type as you doesn't make one or the other of them better.",

Back in January I was having some gastrointestinal issues (blood, diarrhea, etc) so I went to the gastroenterologist and he ran some tests and said it was gluten sensitivity. I've been on a gluten-free diet for the past 6 months but the symptoms weren't getting better. Today I had a colonoscopy and it showed mild ulcerative colitis (proctitis/proctosigmoiditis).... I'm relieved I got a diagnosis but also concerned about what this means for my future. I don't want to take medication my whole life. I have two small children and the idea of having health problems scares me so much ;((( Does anyone on here have this disease or any advice on how to manage it? Thank you.",

I have had to take prednisone sometimes, or use small hydrocortisone enemas to cool off the flare, I can't take sulfa based meds like asacol. The one thing I can say about having U.C. is I know where every bathroom is in most stores, malls, hospitals etc! I suggest watching your diet still, refined sugars, white breads and some red meats cause me intense pain and diarrhea(sorry if tmi). You will have to listen to your body and avoid foods and stressful situations which can cause flares. I know it is tough to be diagnosed, but this can be managed! Please feel free to pm me or I can give you my FB name. You will be okay!",
				"It can absolutely be managed. And if medication is the way, it just is the way. There are orals, mentioned above, injectables and infusions. I've had many many patients tell me they \"got their lives back\" after starting Remicade or Entyvio. Work with your doctor. Be compliant. Report side effects. And mostly, give your treatment plan time. Your body didn't do this overnight. It will take time to recover. You also don't have to go through it alone. There are support groups, I suggest asking your doctor, not necessarily jumping on the first Facebook one you see. See a therapist. They can give you tools to cope with being a mom and having a chronic illness. You're going to be fine. I promise. <3",
				"My FH has it and he is finally getting good treatment from Cleveland Clinic. Its been a rough road. My best advice, coming from someone who doesnt have it but is very close to someone who does, is find out your triggers and be aware of them. FH's favorite foods are his triggers unfortunately. However, everything will send him to the restroom multiple times it just depends on if it starts after 1 bite, half way through the meal, or he can make it through the whole meal. Ive been worried about the amounts of meds he takes daily, it can't be good for anyone but it helps. Look into something that isn't pills, if that makes you feel better. FH was in a study, because he turned into Crohns, for Entivyo. After he stopped responding since he was getting the placebo we found a new doctor. Entivyo actually started to clear it up and started remission (for the study he was given 2 doses of the med then it could have been the placebo or the med). Entivyo was highly recommended by the new doctor especially after the results. But insurance wouldnt approve it so he started Humira injections yesterday.",

He's also in an experimental trial that involves IV treatments that will become less frequent until he hopefully doesn't have to take anything.",
				"I was diagnosed with UC a few years back. I am a teacher so being uncomfortable and having an urge to run to the bathroom is not an option. I take medication on a daily basis. I take balsalazide two times a day and a suppository most nights. I have to say, the medicine helps but I feel like there are other factors I need to be mindful of. Drinking a lot of water everyday is a must. Regular exercise really helps too. Lastly, there are some food I know I need to eat regularly- apples- and food that I can't eat a lot of or it effects me- sugary food gets me. Stress definitely has a big event on me. I try to plan things out so they don't pile up and try not to stress over little things. A lot of stress causes big flare ups for me that won't go away until the stress level lowers. Doing these things, I feel great most of the year. Some I was diagnosed, put on medicine, and figured out what my body can take I've only had one flare up. That was due to stress when my job was changing, planning wedding, and a few deaths in the family. Once stress leveled out I was back to normal. Good luck!",

I lost 15 pounds and couldn't keep any food in my system. I had never been that bad before, so I ended up having to go to the hospital and get a colonoscopy. Since then, they've tried SO MANY drugs for me. Recently, I got really tired of them putting me on meds, so I am currently trying to fix it myself be eating better, putting less stress on myself, limiting alcohol, etc. Meds don't fix the problem, and mine isn't bad enough (thankfully) to need meds all of the time, so I decided to stop them. Something I really noticed that is a trigger for me is caffeine!! I can drink like one 20 oz Coke a day, but any more caffeine than that, and my body goes nuts! Also, anything with gluten will destroy me. I try to stick with gluten free beers and pastas and just not do bread, but it is really hard!! I've also cut back on dairy, and that seems to have worked wonders! Just a few suggestions!",

I am concerned about the effects the medication will have on my organs, but also what the inflammation will do if I don't take it... so it's kind of a double edged sword.

The area that is \"the back of your legs\" is called your hamstrings, and you can't JUST work out your hammies to get rid of cellulite, or to improve the appearance of your legs without looking disproportionate. It's like people who ONLY do squats - you need to work out all the muscles in your legs, not just one muscle, not just one exercise.

				"Sadly, there is nothing that can be done about cellulite. Cellulite is just a made up term and really it's just how we define the way your body lumps the adipose tissue together. Squats and other muscle building activity can help bulk your muscles in those problem areas and can help \"hide\" them somewhat, but realistically, they're there for life. Everyone has these fatty stores, but people with thin, pale skin tend to show it off the most. I have found that for a temporary \"fix\" a deep tissue massage in the fatty areas can help disperse the fat lumps for a day or two. In all reality though, embrace it. Everyone has it... even super models, they just get to airbrush them out of pictures. My biggest word of advice. Fat cells NEVER go away. We can shrink them, but once they're there... they're there for life (unless you them sucked out of you... but that brings other problems). The best thing you can do is not get anymore fat cells (easier said than done, of course). It sounds like you're on the right track of eating healthy and exercising!",
				"I'm going to put this out there even though I'm sure it's an UO. Unless you are an elite athlete, you should not be going to the gym twice a day under any circumstances. You shouldn't even be going once a day without at least one FULL day of rest. It's just not safe for many reasons, and it's very possible for excessive exercise to do damage to your body. Also, you can't lose fat in specific places. Cellulite is a fact of life for women, and there's nothing for it other than an eating disorder.",
				"There is nothing wrong with going to the gym twice a day on occasion. So long as you're not obsessive over it and spending half your day in the gym. I will often go for a run in the morning before work and do a weights workout after work because I don't have the time before/after work to do both. I do agree you should try to give yourself at least one day a week as a rest day so you don't burn yourself out. It sounds like you're on the right track with eating healthy and exercising. Leg workouts can't get rid of cellulite. I build muscle naturally very quickly and my legs are solid muscle and I still have cellulite. Everyone has it; it doesn't matter. FH loves every inch of me. If you are looking to tone up and firm up, leg press, squats, bridges, lunges, and kickbacks will all bring great muscle definition. No one will even notice any cellulite Also, it may just be the placebo effect but Target does sell a Nivea Firming Cream lotion specifically targeted for your booty and legs. I still have my little cellulite pockets but I like to think my skin is looking firmer!",
				"I'm 5'7 and weigh 120 lbs, and practically my entire leg is cellulite. I store all my fat in my legs. It's just the way it is. I hear it can be related to circulation sometimes and \"dry brushing\" might help improve the appearance. To be honest I just moisturize my skin (moisturized skin just always looks better), put on a bathing suit/shorts, and hope for the best. Almost everyone has it.",

				"See your doctor and have him/her help put you on a plan to lose weight in a healthy way. Please don't try any crazy or extream diets (I'm vegetarian btw). Make slow changes to be more healthy in general. Make sure you drink the proper amount of water, get enough sleep and exercise. As for dress shopping you could wait but honestly you can buy a dress that fits and it can be adjusted smaller. 35 lbs is a a lot to lose (obviously it's possible, but just think about everything else going on in your life over the next 10 minutes- your a mom, planninng a wedding and I'm assuming you work a job too.) So don't be unreasonable with yourself- your going to look gorgeous on your wedding day no matter what you weigh. If you are super dedicated to losing that amount you'll need to lose a little less then a pound a week which is fine as long as it's in a healthy way and you're under the care of a good doctor. That's my two cents lol congratulations to you and good luck!",
				"You still have a lot of time to lose the weight. My Fitness Pal and Lose It apps are super helpful. I like the Lose It app better than My Fitness Pal because it's more interactive and if you upgrade to the paid version it gives you meal ideas. It's possible to lose weight without exercising, but exercising will also help you to become healthy overall. If you can't make it to the gym try walking around your neighborhood. Take your girls with you. Or try biking.",

Sometimes you can alter down 2-3 sizes without destroying the integrity of the dressIt is easier to take a dress in than let a dress out, so I advise ordering in your current size.",

				"Use MyFitnessPal so you can track your calories and macros. Cut out/significantly reduce sodium, sugar and white carbs. Don't eat carbs past 7pm. Drink a ton of water (with lemon). Eat all your fruits before noon. Grapefruit works great to help lose weight, as well as adding cayenne pepper seasoning to your meals. Eat lean cuts of meat. Exercise: strength training, and cardio. More of strength training because you will burn an additional 50 calories for every pound of muscle you add to your body. Zumba is a great form of cardio, but if you really want to burn some fat, add HIIT exercise 1-2 a week. I take/am licensed in STRONG by Zumba, but since you can't go to a gym, that's not a program that you can do. But if for some reason you manage to find a way to hit the gym, take that class. Lastly, go hard, but be aware of your limits. Good luck.",

				"I recommend trying the BBG program. It's a fitness app called 'Sweat', you get a week free trial and then it's $20 a month. If you look on instagram or pinterest you can see people's REAL results. I just started this program and I am SORE from day one and it's been 2 days.",
				"Weight watchers!!",
				"The best thing would be to lose the weight slowly so you can keep it off. I recommend adding more veggies to your diet, less meat and limit carbs to once per day. Get yourself an Apple Watch or another fitness band that keeps track of your steps and calories throughout a normal day - try to always increase that number. Also the lose it app is fantastic. It will help you be more conscious about what you're eating. Stay away from things that are sugary or salty. The sugar turns into fat and the salt will bloat you. Other than that when you have any bit of time, try walking or bike riding. It doesn't need to be a lot of time to really add up.",
				"Talk to your Dr. Advocare is also wonderful ! We sell it at our gym. Small changes equal big results sometimes. So begin each week with making a new change. Pinterest has great ideas for home work outs if you can't get to the gym. For me my Doctor has been my saving grace for weight loss for the wedding. We started in November working on a plan and it's been great so far !",
				"I did the Atkins 40 plan last summer and within almost 2 weeks, I lost almost 5lbs. Had I actually stuck with this program, I feel I would have lost more weight. I decided to do Atkins as a way to help me stop eating sugar and carbs, as that is my biggest weakness. I would highly recommend giving this a try! My soon-to-be mother-in-law enrolled in Weight Watchers and followed the program religiously (attended the meetings and all), and lost 30lbs. She continues to maintain her weight as she has learned how to balance her meals, eat proportionally, etc. Both programs are worth a shot! Good luck to you"

I've done a few and if you lose the weight you will always get back AT LEAST what you paid and typically a little extra. So if EVERYONE won, they would forfeit their cut, but it can be motivating when there is money on the line.",
				"You can also look at the app PACT. You have to connect a card and say you are going to work out X amount of times per week, and if you don't each of those days will cost you X amount of dollars. The minimum is $5 per day, but you could set it to 1 time per week, and then you win back a very small percentage. I have it set to 3x a week, at $5 per day. So if I only log 2 workouts they charge me $5. If I work out all 3, I get like 50 cents. Helps me to stay on track and there are multiple ways to log workouts (checking in at gym, syncing with a step tracker and getting 10,000 steps or holding the phone while you work out for 30 min of movement). Also, the achievemint app gives you points for healthy things you do and eventually pays out $10 for every so many points. that is something that works more in the background just for syncing with other apps like a food tracker or fitness tracker.",

			"content": "Guys! My health has gone extremely downhill! I have gained so much in the past year it's not even funny. I have never seen so many stretch marks in my life or experienced as much back pain as I do right now. I am devastated and just pissed at myself. My FH and I have a second round of engagement pics in October and I would like to be at least 30 pounds lighter by then. Is this even doable? I know it's possible to lose 2lbs per week you just have to push yourself! But any advice to overcome this weight gain depression and advice on weight loss would be helpful! I'm at a loss on what to do.",
			"comments": [
				"The best way to get started is to find motivation. I have found that using my FitBit really gets me moving throughout the day, and I WANT to exercise to reach my steps. I also searched Pinterest for tons of workouts to do in both the gym and at home for days when I can't get out. 30 pounds in 5 months is a large amount, I personally have never been able to lose that much in that timeframe.",
				"You're going to get a lot of advice. I just want to say that I'm there too with the non stop weight gain and insane stretch marks. Really bums me out. I've been able to lose 18lbs but have a long way to go. You're not alone!",
				"I wish losing weight was as easy as putting on weight in that you don't really think about it as much when you're putting it on. Is there a reason you can pinpoint that caused you to put on this weight? Start there and try to fix that! Anything is possible, but you deff want to do it in a healthy way. Everyone's body is different so a diet that works for one person may not work for another; however, I lost weight easily and quickly when I cut refined sugars and significantly decreased my carb intake while increasing my protein intake. Oh and portion size is a big factor. Also, don't skip meals cuz it truly doesn't help you in the long run. Multiple smaller meals are deff the way to go. Good luck!!",
				"I believe it's typically one to 1.25 pounds a week for 3-4 pounds a month that's considered healthy. You'd need to lose like 1000 calories a day for two pounds a week",
				"@Kate I will join here in a second To answer questions on why I've gained so much so quick. I will be completely honest, 1. Stress! (I have been seeing a therapist for about a month now to handle my life situations and anxiety) 2. I eat out for lunch almost EVERY DAY. Its horrible. I have to stop! 3. Laziness",
				"When losing weight your diet is generally more important than exercise (something like 70% diet, 30% exercise) but you really should be doing both. Since you're on a time crunch commit to a very specific diet and exercise plan (I really like South Beach, I lost 6lbs in the first two weeks and then 2lbs a week for the next couple of weeks). Don't be afraid to build some muscle since the more muscle you have the easier it is to burn fat.",
				"Using an app like my fitness pal for tracking exercise and food. Also lots of support boards. Realistically after the first week, on whatever plan you choose, you will only lose about a pound a week. Strength training will increase calorie burn and increase metabolism, but any exercise you can do will help.",
				"If your weight gain is not medical, the safest and fastest way to lose weight is to cut out all sugars, unnecessary salt, stop eating out, cook all meals and work out. You can drop a lot of weight fast and in a safe way by this. Please make sure you get your nutrients and still eat food.",
				"I agree with Emily that it's an ambitious goal. It could happen because many people lose a lot in their first couple of weeks, but then lose much more slowly. Keep at it and forgive yourself when you slip. Don't give up.",
				"@Deanna okay great! At least you're able to recognize why you gained weight so you can focus on fixing those areas. You're seeing a therapist.. Awesome! Try meal prepping for the week on Sundays. It's not my fave thing to do, but it saves me the money and extra cals during the week since I won't go out to eat. And hopefully that Facebook group can help you get motivated",
				"Why don't you and you FH go for hikes/walk? go to the gym- i think having him there will give you some motivation. And start bringing you lunch to work- cheaper and healthier!",
				"Just Dance has helped keep me motivated! I love dancing and am a sweaty mess at the end. Going to the gym and running are huge bummers for me. Finally found something fun that I look forward to. Any sport you liked playing in school?",
				"@Amanda do you use pinterest for meal prepping? I just don't want to stick to all those chicken and brown rice and veggie meals, I need more variety! Haha",
				"If you do start really working out as well as dieting, get a measuring tape and focus on inches lost as well as/ instead of pounds on the scale. Muscle weighs more than fat, so you may only lose half a pound one week, but really dropped a pound of fat and built half a pound of muscle, which is more valuable long term than just dropping the pound of fat!",
				"@Maria, I ran cross country and track and played soccer. I was very athletic and now, not so much. Crazy to see how much changes in 7 years out of school HAHA",
				"You can absolutely do it! But you need to be determined about it - because motivation fades. Use a tracker app like My Fitness Pal - track what you what and how you exercise. It helps you set goals too. For my macros, it averages about 1250 calories a day IF I don't work out, but if i work out I can gain some of those back. Drink lots of water - figure out your hunger- if you're actually hungry, or if you're really just thirsty or boredom eating. cut your sugars, less processed food. Also - don't deprive yourself. This will set you up for failure. just look at everything you eat - that tasty donut in the break room - is the momentary satisfaction worth it? Or would a piece of fruit be better? ETA - saw you eat out a lot - cut that down! not only will it save you calories it will save you $$. For your stress - maybe go for walks more often - then you get your personal time AND some exercise",
				"My fitness pal and fitbit helped me drop 15 lbs before the wedding! Gained 5 back in the month since so I have started tracking my food again!",
				"@deanna s. Don't get yourself down. I feel when I focus to much on my weight or body nothing changes. Go for walks,...it will help ease your mind and body., especially of stress. Drink water. Do not step on the scale! Go by how you feel. I had a eating disorder when I was younger. The scale can be your enemy. Focus on what you want to change one day at a time. Keep your chin up girl...you'll be a beautiful bride",
				"Did you find them fun? Maybe recruit a group for soccer. Or just kick a ball with friends or FH?",
				"I am loving everyone's feedback. You guys are making me feel so much better already! Thank you!",
				"@Deanna sometimes, but I am all about kitchen gadgets and I invested in an air fryer and a pressure cooker. I make chicken breast in my pressure cooker and it turns out great and cooks quickly with minimal effort! Air fryer is great too. You don't have to only make fried foods. I make salmon for my FH in it. Oh and crock pots are great too. Lol these things make cooking so easy so you aren't spending hours cooking for the week",
				"@Maria, Soccer was a blast. I have thought about getting a league together or just getting people together one night or two nights a week and play a small game. Running....I have my ups and downs with it. I will start by walking and we will see if I work my way back up to running. @Amanda, I will look into one of those, I've honestly never heard of one. Thank you",
				"@Deanna omg they'll change your life lmao Good luck hun!! You got this! Xo",
				"First you have to forgive yourself for the weight gain being mad at yourself and thinking about it is just counterproductive Lucille is right about figuring out you energy expended. A lot of people live off their fitbits and eat back every single calorie that they burn as well. Then they wonder why they fail. You start with eating balanced meals and create a small deficit. When you feel more confident you can create more deficit by a small reduction in the cals you take in and more movement.",
				"You can do it!! Here are the top things that helped me: - Stop drinking calories! Aka, don't drink anything with sugar. - Cut out carbs or cut way down on carbs. I eat as many veggies and fruits as I want, and lots of protein, but rarely have bread or pasta. This was tough for about 3 weeks (your body goes through carb withdrawal) but then was easier later on. - Meal prep/pack a lunch. I totally hear you on the eating out for lunch thing! My coworkers are the worst influences... I love them dearly but they order in for lunch almost every day. Once they realized that I was consistently packing my lunch, they stopped asking if I wanted to order with them and even starting bringing their own stuff too. I would definitely recommend Pinterest for healthy meal prep recipes. I also use an app called Yummly which lets you sort by ingredient or type of recipe (ex: low carb). I hope this is helpful! Best of luck on your journey.",
				"@Future_mrs.F I am downloading that app right now. Sounds like it may be helpful! Thank you so much! It's actually funny, I work for a company that certifies products as organic so we have a lot of organic health nuts in here. You would think I would have learn something by now LOL",
				"Sing up for 5K- good way to get started. the way i see it, i paid money so better get the training done (walk/run or run), so just forget about the time. go an have fun w a group of people Yoga is also good to deal w depression- its your time! and if you do it at a hot yoga studio you are going to sweat! Good luck!",
				"@Deanna - that's awesome, I hope they're a positive influence/motivator for you then! And hope you like the app too, it's great because it basically searches the internet for you for whatever you're looking for and complies the recipes in one place! Then you can save them based on categories and it will generate things it thinks you might like.",
				"@deanna,S. Going organic was the best thing we could have ever done. We needed a life change, including my son. All three of us have come so far. But we also aren't \"every little thing organic\",..we do have our cheat days lol moderation is key...best of luck to you : )",
				"It really depends on how overweight you are whether or not losing 30lbs in 5 months is going to be difficult. It is 1.5lbs per week (not 2 and that seems like the same thing but it really isn't). I think this is a very doable goal, it won't be easy, but most things aren't easy. You will have to work for what you want, but it's not out of reach at all. You can do it! Track your food (and calories), pack your lunch, make your own food, and move more.",
				"@CatLady5x I definitely want to keep off and keep taking it off because I don't plan on dress shopping until January/February. I like the idea of having a \"Meatless Monday\" or something of that nature. I'm not sure I can afford a gym membership at the moment, but I have access to a bike and a treadmill at home and my best friend can get me into Planet Fitness for free with her pass. I just have to start using all that is available to me.",
				"Get rid of soda and alcohol to start. Try cooking at home once or twice a week to start. Check out the Leslie Sansone walking videos on YouTube for free. They're only 15 min and get you sweating.",
				"I'm seeing a lot of good tips that I will have to try also! Something I want to add that often helps me is to park far away when you go somewhere. I park as far as I can from the building I work in so I get some extra walking in and also wearing high heels helps! I know that sounds crazy but it takes more effort to walk in stilettos than flats and helps your posture winch is good for your back and belly! Just standing up straight can make you look slightly thinner! Carry you groceries back to the car if you can instead of using the buggy. u go shopping don't look for the closest parking space (unless its raining real bad then I take a pass). Find ways to incorporate fitness into your everyday routines. Take the stairs whenever possible, go the long way to the bathroom or use the bathroom further away from your office. Get up from your desk between tasks and stretch . If you have a private office you can close the door and do a quick workout like some jumping jacks. The scientific 7 minute workout is good for when you don't have alot of time!",
				"@Kiera, I love these. Luckily I have a brand new car so parking far away from everyone isn't a problem. I would cry if someone dinged my car HAHA. I wish I had a private office but the girls who are in the same room with me probably won't judge me if I started to do some stretches and stuff",
				"30 pounds may be doable, since that is only 6 pounds in a month. Yes, you can safely lose 1-1/2 to 2 pounds per week, so you only need to do 1.5 pounds each week to reach your goal. I recommend not weighing yourself daily, as you will see lots of fluctuations due to water retention/loss. Pick one day a week, right after you get up and use the restroom in the morning, then weigh yourself. Also, focus on weight training (even small weights) as well as cardio. I know you have heard it before, but muscle does not weight less than fat, it just takes up less space. 1 pound is 1 pound regardless, but 1 pound of muscle is tiny compared to the same weight. Also, you may see a slight increase in the beginning because you may not be losing as much but are gaining muscle. Don't let that discourage you, because that muscle will help increase your metabolism which will make losing weight easier. I second MyFitnessPal, when I use it I am so much more conscious of what I eat and I am able to shed some pounds. The most important thing in my book is, don't get discouraged if you fall off the wagon and eat something crappy. Just start over the next day, and try all over again. That is all you can do.",
				"I second MyFitnessPal. The forums are really helpful. I've been doing the couch to 5K program to get my cardio in check for the past 2 months and it really helped increase my stamina, something I was not able to do on my own. I only have 2 weeks left until I'll be able to run for 30 minutes straight.",
				"@Pickles, I have done the couch to 5k app before and like it, but I stopped in the middle of it. Not sure why, laziness probably haha I will keep it in mind! Due to my back pains, I will stick with walking first, then slowly move my way back up to running.",
				"@Maria H, I love Just Dance! OP, that's a LOT of weight to lose so quickly, BUT everyone is different. You may find you'll lose it quickly by eating healthy and working out, especially if your new calorie intake is a substantial differential.Maybe if you startt working out you'll be happier with your body even if the scale indicates more.Good luck!",
				"It is doable. Monitor your eating and stay active",
				"I've seen a lot of these lately. My suggestion (because I do it) is Beachbody. I'm not a super fan of shakeology which is their meal replacement shake so I just skip that. They promote the 21 day fix eating plan which when you look it for the first time seems very daunting. However it is amazing and you are gonna be eating all damn day so you won't be hungry. It's about portion control and exercise. You have MANY options for exercise from beginner to advanced (think p90x which you can do if you so choose). Everyone here is going to tell you to cut carbs and sugar and blah blah blah. They aren't wrong but this gives you a way to do it with little effort on your part. I suggest this to anyone and everyone who asks. It's a game changer and a life changer",
				"I hate the term diet, it's not sustainable. I suggest My Fitness Pal too, I'm not as consistent anymore but it helped me open my eyes... I thought I could just grab a handful of almonds anytime but it all adds up. Start slow and be patient. If you slip, just get right back into it.My favorite quote I've heard is \"bodies are made in the kitchen\"Good luck!! Keep us posted!",
				"I'm using this app and I love it, it tells you how many calories you have to eat to lose the weight you want by the time you need to lose it, it has helped me a lot, I hope it helps you too.",
				"The BIGGEST and very best thing you can do is cut out sugar!!!!!!! Sugar is in just about EVERYTHING, so watch what you are putting in your body! We are technically only supposed to consume about 20 grams of sugar a day, but when everything you are eating has sugar in it, it's too easy to surpass that number. (Most sodas have 30-45 grams of sugar in one can!) I did a 30 day sugar cleanse once, completely cutting out obvious sweets like candy and cookies and such, and only allowed myself to intake about 8 grams of sugar a day. I really had to watch what I was eating, but I lost 10 pounds in that 30 days (mostly eater weight) and I felt AMAZING. You can do it! Just do it in a healthy way! Do not starve yourself! Also, exercise",
				"You can do it! I am at 40lbs and Saturday marks 5 months. Honestly my eating habits were terrible. I ate a lot of fast food and pop. I eliminated all beverages other than water, pork and beef. I use my fitness pal to track my calories. its definitely doable! I have not exercised at ALL. I want to lose 5 more lbs then I will focus on toning.",
				"Omni diet and follow it !! You can lose 1 pound each day I lost 30 pounds in 28days",
				"Starting second round next week",
				"Well for one, don't compare yourself to the way you looked in high school. Of course you'd be a lot skinnier if you were running as much as a part time job. I lost 30 lbs in 5 months for my college graduation. It was actually pretty easy after two weeks because my cravings subsided. All I did was started lifting/working out 4-5 days a week and cut out chips, sweets and eating out (chips are my weakness). I started eating fruit with whipped cream on it as a night time snack. My doctor gave me a sheet to follow. It basically just said eat as much fruit, veggies and meat as you want but stay under 50 carbs for everything else you eat.",
				"I changed how I ate and was able to lose about 50 pounds in a 6 month period. 16 of those pounds were in one month. I don't eat as strictly as I did before, and I have cheat days when I want them, but I've been able to maintain my weight loss. (eta: spelling)",
				"30lbs in 5mths is a lot. I mean can it be done, is health to do so..eh not really.",
				"I've lost 20 in the last 3 months. I started seeing a dietitian. She is super strict, I have to weigh in with her 3x a week. I log all of my food and exercise and she reviews it. I lack accountability. That is why I don't do well with online systems. Maybe find a weight loss group that you can connect with to help keep you going.",
				"Whatever you do, start slow. Don't drastically change your diet/exercise patterns. Try to add one healthy habit - whether it's having a salad for lunch, going for a brisk walk, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, having less soda/cookies (whatever your temptation) - every 2 weeks or so. See how it goes.",
				"I've lost 22 pounds in 2.5 months and have managed to keep it off (even losing more weight). I started with doing a whole 30 and now have converted that into a lifestyle where I eat paleo 95% of the time. It has completely changed my relationship with food. I just sat through a 3 hour meeting with snacks all around and didn't want any of it. In fact, the smell of the oreos on the table in front of me was making me sick.Try diet and exercise together. You can't exercise your way out of a terrible diet.Good luck!",
				"I didn't read all the comments so please forgive me for echoing others. A Fitbit is a wonderful investment. I'm wearing mine right now. Unfortunately, I've gained around 14 pounds since the beginning of the year and I feel so ashamed because of it. So you're definitely not alone girl. 30 pounds is very doable if you are healthy enough to be active to burn the correct amount of calories to lose 30 pounds. Ah and to add- I noticed part of the reason why I gained so much weight and didn't notice was because I moved into my FH's apartment and there were no long mirrors. I gain weight in my legs and ass first. So you can imagine the shock I had when I finally got a long mirror and the difference was very noticeable. I knew I'd gained weight of course but not being able to SEE the changes really screwed me. SO- I recommend a FitBit if you don't already have one and long mirrors if you don't already have some. They both can make a huge difference. I wish you luck!",
				"Buying a food scale has helped me tremendously. It got one for $10 on Amazon. I have been weighing my food for every meal,snack, recipe I make.It is truly the only way to accurate measure how many calories you are eating.I was amazed when I got it! I had definitely been eating 300-500 more calories everyday than I thought I was! I then track all of my food on myfitnesspal. I have joined the Facebook group and just ordered myself a Fitbit!",
				"Echoing PP: 1. Download My Fitness Pal and get an idea of what you're consuming, then start tracking 2. Meal prep your lunches. This is for sure what keeps me thin. Lol. Even something \"healthy\" like a burrito bowl at Chipotle has 800+ calories, too much for me! 3. Diet > exercise. You cannot out exercise your eating out every day. See #2",
				"If you can afford it join a group excercise class or accountability program such as weight watchers so you have fun while getting your health on track. (If group support is your thing) I know others prefer at home based stuff. Don't focus on a number focus on health and endurance and it will seem much more doable and less frustrating. Maybe get FH on board for some workouts to keep ya movin!",
				"You can do it! You have to stay consistent though!",
				"I need to lose as much weight as possible in 3 months as well. I cut out as much carbs and sugar as possible, and am eating a high-protein diet. I started working out (only 2x a week for now, hoping to increase that by working out at home). I also stopped drinking diet coke and stopped drinking my sugary, chocolatey, creamy coffees. Now I just add a little almond milk. I have done weight watchers with success in the past and also gained only 11 pounds in my pregnancy because I had a strict diet with gestational diabetes. I am doing my best to combine what I have learned from each diet to just eat better overall. Good luck!",
				"Try myfitnesspal app",
				"Fitbit and a gym buddy",
				"I was able to lose 30lbs in 3 months. It took ALOT of dedication and discipline. I meal prepped and worked out 4-5 times a week for at least an hr",
				"It is absolutely doable, with the right tools. Look for a studio in your area that offers, nutrition and workouts. Make all the difference.",
				"I joined weight watchers when I got engaged because I had gained 40 pounds since he and I had met. I've lost 18 pounds in 6 weeks just from changing my eating habits. I used to eat out everyday for lunch too so now I meal prep for the week on Sundays. It definitely takes dedication and a big motivator for me was specifically ordering my dress a little smaller after discussing my goals with the dress consultant.",
				"In 4 months, I lost 27 pounds (only 3 more pounds until my goal!). All I did was download the MyFitnessPal App and count my calories. Because I still wanted to be able to eat, I cut out some of the higher calories things like potatoes and breads and ate a lot more veggies and meats (especially pork). I stick to 1200 calories a day with one cheat MEAL (not day) per week. However busy weeks sometimes I cheat a little more (last week I graduated & had a graduation party so I didn't stick to the diet so well). I found that besides weighing myself, measuring my waist helped me stay motivating because I could see the progress! Good luck!!",
				"I'm trying to lose weight as well. I have found that I get the best results when I eat right. Regardless of how much time I spend in the gym I don't lose pounds unless I'm eating right. Good luck!",
				"Try the Paleo diet look it up a friend of mine tried and lost a lot of weight in just under two months",
				"Hey I lost 20 pounds in 3 months. I cut the sweets, pop, and also bread I do Herbalife it's great I have 30 more I want to lose you can do it stay focused and positive",
				"Regarding eating out at lunch every day- i have that terrible habit! I started leaving my cards/cash with FH when I leave for work. He makes sure I have gas before I go, and I have an emergency credit card if I break down, but that's it. It sucked the first two days because I kept forgetting lunch, but then I started remembering to pack. And I eat way healthier since I pack at home and can't fry anything in grease. Grease... I miss you..",
				"@Mary I am so glad I'm not the only one. Those are really good ideas. Thank you!!",
				"I have been listening to a podcast called Half Size Me. She's great! She pushes Weight Watchers a lot because that's what she used but she is still very motivating. One thing she brought up was that if you think about how much weight you gained and how long it took, versus the rate at which you are losing, it is actually faster to intentionally lose weight than passively gain it. Just something that was super motivating for me.",
				"Focus more on how you look and feel versus total weight loss. If you really ramp up work outs and clean up your diet, you may find you only need to lose 15 pounds in that amount of time to look and feel good. Take measurements and go from there!",
				"It's possible but it's commitment ... I agree that you should join the Facebook group..",
				"Hey girl! So first off, I absolutely believe in you and it will be difficult, but it's totally possible to lose 30 lbs in 5 months. Have you ever heard of Jillian Michaels? If not, she's a fitness trainer who sells EXTREMELY effective workout videos. They're available at stores such as Walmart, Target, etc for about $10 and trust me - they are worth every penny. You get results and you get them quickly. Even without drastically altering your food choices, you will lose weight. If you maintain a healthy diet too, girlllll those pounds will be falling off. I would start off with either 30 Day Shred or (my personal favorite) Ripped in 30. They're AWESOME! As far as managing the depression, I would just try and maintain an open discussion with someone you trust to vent to and have them pick you up when you're down. Maybe get a workout buddy? You got this girl, I know you can do it!",
				"See a nutritionist and figure out a food plan that works for you! 80% of losing weight is food related. You got this! I lost 10-15 pounds one summer from cutting out carbs.",
				"I've lost 30 lbs in the last 5 months by eating clean, cutting out sugar, low carb, and no grains. I don't work out.",
				"I've lost exactly 30 pounds in 5 months on Weight Watchers. It's up to you how you do it, but it certainly is doable",
				"I am in the same boat you are right now and have till November. I just got my Fitbit Blaze and am going to do Orange Theory twice a week and start the C25k app. I also plan to continue with lower carbs and really monitoring what I eat with MyFitnessPal.",
				"You can do it, just set realistic goals and remember that it takes time to gain weight so it will take time to lose it. Since March I've lost 18 pounds, so about 6 pounds per month. I walk, do yoga tapes, hike or do an elliptical workout (I have a machine at home) at least 5 days per week, 45 minutes each time. I have found that making activity of some sort part of every day has helped a lot. Also, I started tracking my calories using my Samsung Health App. I set a step goal, activity minutes goal, and calorie goal for myself and have found that having that accountability has helped. Tracking calories has helped me be more mindful of what, when and why I am eating (HUGE emotional eater here - I had lost 10 pounds at the end of last year then my cat of 15 years was diagnosed with terminal cancer and I gained it all back in 2 months). Sustained weight loss and improved health is a lifelong goal and takes constant vigilance. Set realistic goals and celebrate when you meet them. Look at this at a long term life strategy and you will be more successful. Best of luck to you - YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!",
				"Your diet is the #1 factor in weight loss that everyone will tell you and it is so so true but it is so much harder than it sounds. (at least for me) I won't get into that part of it, but one of my favorite visual and tactile markers that I like to use is to take two jars and fill one however many pounds you want to loose (using marbles) and for each pound you loose, take a marble out and move it to the other jar. Watching the marbles move and seeing how far I've come is very motivating for me. Also makes gaining a pound or three harder when I have to take them out of my \"weight lost\" jar. Of course, the numbers aren't everything, you might loose fat and gain muscle and maintain your weight, but loose inches which is what we all really want. But for me, I had a lot of fat to loose and am still doing it mostly through diet so the marble trick really worked to get me started.",
				"Yes, I've heard 2 lbs per week is doable as well but I've also heard you can probably lose more than that if you are really overweight. In 2011 I went low carb and did an hour of cardio 4 or 5 days a week and I went from 218 to 185 in about 4 months or so, maybe 5. If you drink soda, diet or regular, do yourself a favor and switch to water. That will help a lot. Since you go out to eat a lot, try ordering from a kids menu, or splitting a meal with someone since restaurant meals are often bigger than necessary. There a lot of apps that can help.. carb counters, calorie counters, couch to 5k if you are interested in running but aren't so great at it now. And then the old tips we all know, take stairs not the elevator, park further away than necessary for more of a walk. Try drinking a full glass of water 5 minutes or so before meals so you won't over indulge. If you like to eat pasta or other starchy or high calorie foods, incorporate spinach or broccoli into it so you can still eat what you like but you have some healthier foods in their being used as fillers. Look on pinterest! There are also some inspirational youtubers out there. Good luck! Also remember you may plateau, but don't be discouraged!",
				"While losing weight can be tough, there are programs out there that work wonders. I've been on Weight Watchers for 6 months and have lost 32 pounds. I'm sure if I were more strict with it and exercised regularly that number would be higher, but I'm averaging around 1.3lbs lost per week and I'm not starving myself or doing some crazy fad diet that deprives me of all my favorite foods.",
				"I was able to lose 23 pounds in one week but I was hit by a car, broke my neck, and was in the hospital for 2.5 months. I had damaged my esophagus in the neck break so I wasn't able to eat solid foods or drink liquids for a while. But I don't recommend the hospital diet!"

			"content": "Hi everyone. First time posting here and I'm stressing big time. My wedding is just 63 days away and i'm still recovering from knee surgery (3/2) that was supposed to be simple. Arthro scope to clean up under knee cap - Dr. decided to do an 'aggressive' partial lateral release while he was in there. KNOWING my wedding is July 1st. Flash forward 7 weeks later and I can bend my knee 85 degrees but i'm still in an immobilizer as knee is very unsteady and i'm unable to get back to level of activity i was at pre-surgery. I'm gaining weight, and stressing out - as I need to go in for my 1st fitting in 2 weeks. Anyone have any tricks for me aside from starving myself? My FH bought us a pack of 10 dance lessons which we have been able to use only 1 of since this surgery fiasco. I'm down in the dumps and struggling. On top of all of this, I had to fire my wedding planner for breach of contract and now have to sue to recoup $.",

				"I'm sorry you're dealing with all of this! Don't starve yourself, but definitely watch your intake. Make most of your calories come from fruits and veggies. Don't actually cut anything out, because you'll binge later on. Just eat moderately sized portions. Another way to make sure you don't overeat is to eat small meals throughout the day instead of 3 big ones. I used myfitnesspal to count calories for a while and it really helped. Can you walk? Start by taking walks in the evening, even just short ones at first. Understand you may not lose any weight, but this will help you not gain more. Also, you're going to get some terrible weight loss advice from this forum. Idk why everyone loves to give crappy advice about this, but stay healthy please! What happened with the wedding planner? That's miserable. Have you/are you going to hire a new one?",
				"Oh no! This sounds so stressful. I'm sorry you're going through this. I know when I'm stressed out, I tend to eat more. Maybe you could keep easy healthy snacks around so that you can still eat when you're stressed. Raw veggies are a great option because they're still satisfyingly crunchy, but there are very few calories in them.",
				"Im so sorry you are going through all this. Dont starve yourself, eat 4 small portions a day and raw veggies are a good option",
				"Download the MyFitnessPal app and use that to make sure you're not overeating. Losing weight is 90% diet 10% exercise, realistically, so if you measure and weigh everything you eat it will work for you.",
				"I'm so sorry this is happening to you! I agree with PP to keep lots of veggies on hand for snacking. For working out, I'd suggest getting some small hand weights. You can do arm exercises while sitting and watching tv! Good luck!",
				"Wedding planner was paid up front (BIG MISTAKE) and she didn't help me find vendors at all. Sent me 3 vendors for photography and 2 for catering. Was planning on having wedding at friends farm (hay fields) and reception on our small farm. She was told up front photography and food were VERY important to me...and the vendors she sent me didn't match stylistically at all. Their prices were exorbitant and quotes came back as high as entire wedding budget. So i had to fire her on valentines day - and she's claiming she did 8 hours of work on my behalf... It's all a legal mess now and I am suing her for full amount back since she did nothing. She wouldn't respond to my emails, phone calls for days at a time. Never provided a 'style board' as was promised at least 5 times. She was horrible. I think she took all my $ and spent it and then decided she was going to 'phone it in'. All a mess... Anyways thanks for pep talk on diet. It's been tough.",
				"Fruits and veggies are your best friends. See if your PT has some suggestions. I admit I am kinda surprised you'd have surgery of this magnitude so close to your wedding.",
				"I agree w/ Bemyguest, Walking at your own pace will help you. Try walking at a speed of three in the treadmill. I had knee issues and had to wear a brace until the swelling and lent subsided. One big thing that I did to lose weight was cut sugars, whole dairy and processed foods. This means no food from a box or a drive through. And no \"Cow Milk\". We use organic eggs and almond milk. We also read ingredients in everything. Meal prep on Sunday's so you don't have much to do during the week but with the wedding planning I know how you feel because my wedding is 7/2/17. But breath. Everything will come together. I also have a Fitbit so that motivates me too.",
				"@c4taSorry about your knee. I am also sorry about your planner situation. Did you contact a lawyer before firing her? Because with what you describe, it sounds like you technically breached the contract and that trying to get your money back will be an uphill battle.Even if you thought she was doing a bad job on picking vendors, that is subjective. Also, taking a few days to return phone calls and emails will not matter unless your contract explicitly spelled out that she must be available constantly and quickly return communication. The never produced style board is your best defense to instead prove that she breached first. Although, she can say you didn't give her a chance to finish it and there was likely no explicit timeline for that in your contract. I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news, but hopefully this will guide another bride to not fire a vendor thinking they will be able to recoup payment. This is almost a classic example of anticipatory breach from law school contracts exam. My main point of advice--do not fire/cancel a vendor you think is doing a poor job or is showing signs of unreliability until after you tell them your concerns and give them a chance to fix and reassure performance. Also, consult a lawyer before expecting to recoup money by suing someone.",
				"I'm so sorry about your situation, both your surgery recovery and your terrible wedding planner! Do you have friends that have recently gotten married in the area that you can ask for recommendations? 2 months is tight but doable for finding vendors but I have faith in you!!",
				"I didn't put the full story in on the wedding planner fiasco. I gave her ample time and multiple opportunities to rectify her bad work. This went on for months. Needless to say I have of course contacted an attorney and I'm well within my rights. The reason for my post wast the wedding planner, but the surgery. Surgery wasn't supposed to be complicated. it was supposed to be a simple procedure that I could walk out of the surgery center under my own power. Dr. didn't know apparently what he was going to find until he was in there. Then he made the decision to do more than i wanted/bargained for. What's done is done. This was my 4th knee surgery and although i have made a lot of progress since, it's just slow and is causing me strife. I was merely looking for suggestions on how to keep spirits up and small things i can do that maybe i haven't thought of yet to break the dole drums and see light at the end of the tunnel. Trying to keep it positive",
				"Keep your spirits up! Drink veggie (and some fruit) smoothies for meals and snacks, then eat a plant based dinner. Cut dairy and wheat products. My fave smoothie is bananas, tons of spinach, almond milk, a little honey, and 2-3 spoonfuls of pb2 (peanut butter powder). So yum https://www.amazon.com/PB2-Powdered-Peanut-Butter-Bundle/dp/B00ABKWSTA/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1493040463&sr=8-1&keywords=pb2",
				"Is there a pool anywhere near you? When I destroyed my knee swimming was my go to workout.",
				"Drinking lots of water and eating healthy food is a great way to go. Also walk on a treadmill on very slow pace and slowly work your way up.",
				"@c4ta I know some yoga positions may be beneficial too, especially with the stretching. I'd talk to a physical therapist about this first though (an in no way am I giving you any advice about which poses because I don't know your situation or mobility level, just saying there are some that can be beneficial!)",
				"Im so sorry you're going through all of this. Please don't starve yourself that's about the worst thing you could do for your body. just eat healthy food and eat smaller meals throughout the day, eating more veggies and fruit will also help",
				"Im so sorry youre going through this... I hope that you have a speedy recovery. Definitely try to eat as healthy as you can the time being. ETA my wedding is june 30 and thats 68 days away btw..",
				"@AD, Apparently i cant count. Haha. Im in p/t as i type this. 3x/week since the procedure. Probably will be in still for another 2 months. My therapist knows my concerns and is trying to help. Its hard to burn the calories however when you cant even do a full totation on life cycle. But i am excersizing every day, even on offp/t days. I think its the restrictions on calories im having a hard time with. I restricted before the surgery and i have to further restrict now. Just feel like im at not being able to have more than 2,000 calories/day."

				"Sorry but I'm going to disagree with Kelly C on this one. That kind of exercise is not going to make you lose fat on your back. You can't spot reduce, and \"toning\" is not a thing. Up your diet and exercise game (cardio AND lifting) and some of the fat you lose will hopefully be from your back.",

				"What have you been trying so far? Have you noticed any results? They say a flat tummy is made in the kitchen, not the gym.. and the same goes for back fat. Exercise will only help so much, you NEED to eat a healthy diet to lose weight. I would say starting now until the wedding you need to cut out sugar, salt, and starches. Eat a high protein diet with mostly veggies. And lots of water. Good luck!",

				"I literally JUST came from my fitting and I had this sameThing going on. The seamstress undid the top to clasps of my corset bra and it helped loads!",
				"Please, for the love of God do not listen to Jessica. In order to lose weight you need a healthy diet. Fat is good for you. Your body will freak out without it. DO NOT CRASH DIET. I would start lifting and doing planks. Also it may be the dress. Do you have pictures of the dress?",

I gained just enough back fat my dress became too tight.Over the course of 2 weeks on a diet I lost 8 pounds. But when I started drinking this from Trim Healthy Mama I lost 6 pounds in 3 days!

				"THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! This is good. I'm going to first try to loosen up the corset if that doesn't help then i might have to call the lady who did my alterations to see if she has any advice or if there is anything she can do for me. your right crash dieting isn'ta going to help and isn't worth it.

				"Kate & Laura thank you so much that makes me feel a ton better. I don't need that stupid corset thing anyways.",
				"Your dress is SO pretty! And honestly, I see that in a lot of strapless dresses, especially before final alterations. If you call your seamstress she should be able to help with it, esp. if you get cups sewn in on your dress. I'm in pretty good physical shape and was really on it in the months leading up to my wedding, and I still had a ton of this going on before I got my dress altered! I honestly think part of it comes from having the dress fit so tight so that you can wear it without fear of falling down! I have few wedding pictures where I see little bumps hanging over the edge of the dress, but honestly that's just my body and it's how I looked on my wedding day, and DH married me regardless of those little bumps so what do I care You are the only one that will notice them or worry about them!",
				"Lol just taught this stuff yesterday to my exercise science students. Scientifically speaking you can not spot reduce weight loss. Nor will you be able to see a difference in the 37 days. In order to loose fat, HIIT training along with weight training will help you loose the most calories from fat. Honestly the dress in the back looks like it is too tight. If you are wearing a corset this could be why! Loosen that sucker up and it should help!",
				"I was actually freaking out about this yesterday. It seems like it's just a thing that happens with strapless dresses. I learned that you can actually have someone reach into your dress to smooth you out. You usually need to adjust your boobs once you get the dress on to make them look their best, and the same thing is supposed to help with your back. I'm planning on trying that out at my next fitting.",
				"Back Boobs? Never even heard of back boobs, sorry, op. I am not being sarcastic. Just don't know what back boobs are. :-/ ETA- ok, op... I just saw that you posted a picture of what you call \"back boobs\". (why haven't I heard of this before?!) Do you think the alterations person can maybe extend the top part a little?",

				"Your dress is beautiful - and agreed with the fit of the corset, if you have one.",
				"@sarizzleshizzle. let the back out slightly and you will go into place nice and smooth then have alterations handle it. That is their job, do not attempt a fad diet, crash diet, or cleanse at this point. The last thing you need is to feel like shit physically and emotionally on your day. You are not the problem, the gown just needs tweaked.",
				"Jesus Christ. I'm with Penny on this- the amount of crappy advice is nauseating. Jessica- please don't ever fucking say that shit again. It's wrong- and possibly damaging to people's health. Secondly- Alli = anal leakage. So- I mean- if you want to deal with that- go right the fuck head. But the smart and sensible thing to do would have been start this process 6-12 months ago. But- since you're a month out- and you've already been fitted- you don't want to make major changes- you just want to stay where you are- which means don't do anything. loosen the dress a little and you'll be fine.",
				"OP- don't think you have back boobs.. it may just be the dress... I mean, I may be wrong but I feel like the dress might just be slightly tight on the top part. Your dress is lovely!",
				"You should definitely try loosening the dress. Also, this may sound weird lol, but my friend had this problem at her wedding and her seamstress actually told her to have someone basically \"push\" the fat/skin in once the dress is tied. If that makes sense. It's not an all night solution because once you start dancing and the dress shifts it's going to come back out. But it would work for the ceremony at least. But honestly, I think for you just loosening the back a little will solve your problem.",
				"OP I second Kaylie's suggestion to \"tuck\" your back into the dress. I had a strapless dress and I actually got a bolero to wear over it to hide some discoloration on my chest, but during alterations I noticed a huge difference when I would tuck my back in and I didn't even have a corset back. Loosen the corset a touch and instead of lifting everything out to tighten the corset, just try to smooth your upper back down into the dress. Sorry if that's a bad explanation, but I hope it makes some sense.",

				"Mrs Sullivan to be- isnt that dress amazing!!! #1 it has pockets?! and deep ones! i keep thinking of all the things I can put in there! #2 this is my favorite-you can straight up stick your belly out as far as you can and cant tell! the power of the empire waist! I do have a few questions for you... are you leaving yours as is or are you adding a belt? also what veil are you wearing with yous? how are you wearing your hair? what jewelry are you wearing....lol sorry just trying to get some ideas.",
				"I also had my seamstress basically \"tuck me back in\". She ran her hands along the top of my dress and smoothed out my back. This sounds like it makes no sense but I went from having back boobs (weird) to not having them in a matter of seconds.",
				"Prison Mike-thank you so much! that makes me feel sooo good!!! xoxoxox",

				"Work out, eat right and do a 24 day challenge by Advocare!!",
				"A lot of times the \"smoothing\" is fine because it's not back fat- it's usually just skin. And guess what- skin is squishy and can be pushed around and manipulated- if you squeeze your body into a fitted dress then it's going to squeeze out the top- smoothing it back down under the dress is realistic and reasonable.",
				"Kate- seriously- anal leakage is enough makes me think the only reason that product works is because you want to NOT eat. which also means- you don't eat more unfortunately. so- in theory it would work. but- I mean- starving yourself is a way- but shitting your pants man- woof.",
				"@Sarizzle, I am adding a belt. I have it narrowed down to a few. I just feel like it needs a little bling. I'm also wearing a hair piece of some sort. I orginally wanted my hair all down and curly and wanted a blingy head band, but now I'm obsessed with hair vines so I may do a little pulled back so it'll work. Again, whatever I get with have a little sparkle to it. Not doing a veil at all, never was my thing. Also wearing drop earrings and a super chunky bracelet. Not wearing a necklace at all. I love the dress, I kept saving it online before I went to see it and before it was even zipped it was a yes!",
				"@bookcasehat thank you so much! that means a lot to me! and your right its probably something that only I would notice",
				"A healthy(ish) diet combined with a little increased activity will help a lot. Below is the way I've found to make it work without feeling like I'm \"on a diet\". Myfitnesspal is an awesome tool for being mindful of your intake vs output. The first 3 days or so on a 1350 cal diet can be rough until you kinda figure it out. Dannon makes an excellent 80 cal greek yogurt that has 15g of protein and makes an excellent breakfast. If I'm too lazy to chew I'll have an Atkins chocolate shake. If you do coffee, sub out your normal mixer for coffeemate sugar free vanilla or hazelnut (i actually like it better). The creamer switch alone did a lot for me (insulin resistant). I usually get hungry before lunch and find fruit works well (two halos/cuties if you like citrus, a plum, an apple, strawberries, or a ton of blackberries) For lunch I typically do something like a smoothie (just FYI I'm vegetarian in case you're wondering where all the meat is. If you eat meat, definitely incorporate lean meats for protein) or a veggie sandwich with a veggie patty. Usually that's around 290 ~ 350 cals. I usually need a snack around 4-5pm (right around when I'm leaving work). I may have another piece of fruit (I really like fruit and it's easy to take to work), cheese stick, popcorn, whatever... By dinner I usually have around 450-700 calories left depending on the day so I get to go ham. Here you can eat what you want, just watch your portions. Sub hash browns for fries ( a cup of hash browns is like 60 cals), check the cals on the bread you buy (we found buns for 120 cals), and watch your condiments. If you like mayo, look for the brand \"Just Mayo\". It's vegan mayo (I don't taste a difference) and use a tea spoon to spread instead of a knife (weird but it really works. Honestly 2 tsp of mayo is a ton on a burger). Ketchup is not bad in terms of calories. I'm a serious snacker so that has been an issue. Milano makes \"minis\" that are awesome because you get six smaller cookies instead of two big ones. Halo Top ice cream is THE BOMB. Seriously the entire pint of chocolate is 260 calories, it has extra protein, and it's low in sugar (it tastes amazing). If chips are your thing, buy the pre portioned \"snack variety packs\". If you're out of calories and still craving something sweet, do honey and tea. Don't beat yourself up about going a couple of hundred calories over your goal from time to time. The few days before your period you actually burn more than you usually do so it's ok to indulge a little. As long as you stay below your basal metabolic rate (there are calculators on the internet that can give you an approximate; mine is 1460 cals per day) you're ok. Be sure to drink your water. Buy a marked 40oz bottle and fill it up while you're at your desk. If it's there you will drink it. Try to drink 2 of those a day (trust me, it's not hard if it's right next to you). Exercise. I really don't like \"exercise\". However, I enjoy moving throughout the day. To get extra steps I'll do the longer walk to the bathroom or to the water cooler. I'll stop and mosey around a store on my way home. Junk like that. If you like video games, get up and walk around every time there's a loading screen (you can easily get an extra mile doing this). For toning I like to work that into stuff I have to do anyway. Waiting on the microwave? push ups against the counter. Brushing my teeth? Squats or calf raises. Sometimes I like to mess with my dog by hopping like a bunny around the living room (gives her the zoomies). If you have back pain, get some cheap resistance bands (the loop ones), take them to work and do \"butterflies\" at your desk. Just do a few of those and I promise you'll notice some changes pretty quickly.",
				"I need this too lol",
				"Eww the anal leakage comment made me think of that time a character on degrassi took diet pills and had... issues... blechh@OP you look gorgeous!!! Just loosen the back a little and tuck yourself in",
				"I have that problem in my dress. I think its my corset back or my bra. Talk to the alterations person. When he came in the room to have a look, first, my dress wasn't on properly and then the sales lady didn't strap it up correctly creating back boob. A lot of times, its the corset and how we have the dress on.",
				"I would first start with healthy eating. Protein & portions are key.. as for a workout I'd checkout the web site bodybuilding.com! They are very helpful & you can even call them & they are more than happy to answer any questions you may have",
				"First of all, I don't see \"back boobs\", and believe me...I've seen them. I'm not getting into the dieting and exercise debate. What has always worked for me is healthy eating and watching my fat and sugar intake...but, the results don't always happen where we want them to happen, especially in a month. Area targeted exercise might help, but I think it takes longer than a month to see a dramatic difference. Let me start by saying that the front of the gown is gorgeous. You look stunning in it. Does the back look a little too tight -- well, I'm not going to tell you something you haven't already concluded -- slightly, yes, it does (and it's not extreme...and believe me, I've seen extreme on this site). The fix is not some stupid crash diet. The fix is loosening the dress. If the seamstress has to let the back panels out 1/4\" on each side, then that's what she has to do. Also, consider finding a specialty lingerie shop -- not sexy lingerie, but real, foundational garments. They have pieces that work magic -- though not inexpensive (and you'll probably never wear it again, but who cares? You've invested a small fortune in your wedding day attire. What's another $80?). If you have no other options, and this really screws with your confidence (and I don't think it should), then buy a bolero for the ceremony, and toss it at the party.",
				"Another quick fix LOL when I went to try my dress on is the lady smoothed the back boobs/fat to the front and then tightened the dress it made a huge difference",
				"Why don't you just get the dress to fit right? 37 days isn't enough time it seems"

				"Honestly, drink water. But a normal amount. There has been this crazy drive to encourage people to drink like 8 cups a day. No, drink a normal amount, like whenever you are thirsty. Regular sleep cycle. I have seen so many academic papers citing that the number one reason that people are bloating/not losing weight is because they don't get enough sleep! Decrease your salt intake. This causes bloating because our bodies have an interesting time balancing our salt concentration.",
				"Oh and of course. Cardio and weight lifitng always helps, and eating less than you burn.",
				"Not a doctor here but I've lived in this body my whole life. I notice a decrease in bloat when I eat a clean diet. Mainly avoiding processed/salty foods/ restaurants etc. However, if you consistently eat healthy, that might just be your body. Or something else is going on? ETA: autocorrect",
				"These really aren't healthy. Like pp's have said, your liver and kidneys do all the cleansing you need. Also TMI but I've had problems with gas and bloating lately, and I've found that eating a healthy diet and taking a probiotic has been helpful.",
				"Your kidney and liver to all the cleaning you need.",
				"USUALLY, your liver and kidney do all cleaning, but not always. If you have underlying issues like chronic constipation, IBS, food allergies,etc, your body may not detoxify properly. Some people do have a build up of fecal matter that needs to be expelled. I am not promoting the detox, BUT there are ways to clean yourself out naturally. As a nurse, one of the best ways I have seen is completely natural and doesn't deplete your body of essential nutrients. Take 8 oz orange juice with pulp 1 Tablespoon ground flax seeds about 1-2 OZ Pure Aloe Vera juice. You can always add water if you want. Drink this daily and you will see healthy colon relief, just be aware that sometimes the Aloe Vera will give you gas for a couple of days when starting it.",
				"If you're constipated you need to A. evaluate your diet and any medications you may be taking and or B. talk to a doctor. A lot of people try to go on a diet and do \"low fat\" diets- they up their fiber content (salads and leafy greens + protein) and then drop fats (because FAT IS BAD- don't get me started)- and all the sudden they can't poop. Well- fat greases the skids. Low fat is one of the worst things that ever happened to this country- you 100% need fat in your life. Fat doesn't make you fat- and it helps you poop. Go get some five guys- you'll be \"detoxing\" within a few hours.",
				"Someone mentioned flax seed which is great as well. I add it to smoothies and yogurt. And like @Jo said, your body needs fat. You're 100% better off eating real butter than some chemical \"lite\" substitute. Real ingredients in moderation.",
				"@jo fat greases the skids I can't",
				"No crazy cleanses... to decrease bloating-drink plenty of water, eat clean, consider a probiotic(it helped me get more regular-TMI) and get a decent amount of exercise....cleanses and short term things like that are just that--short term... the results don't typically last... also if you drink, quitting for awhile can really reduce this. (avid wine drinker here though) you may need to look at your eating/dieting habits and reconsider..i know some that do great on a Keto or high fat diet. some that fast until noon daily...whole30 type diets...just consider something that you can stick with long term...for me that's eating clean about 80% of the time and indulging the other 20...",
				"So realistically your body should do this for you which others have pointed out. Unfortunately not everyone has the willpower of a lion (most people don't). If you decide to do a cleanse, consider an all natural one (i.e. Juice cleanse or green smoothies) rather than over the counter pills. With any cleanse that you are completely detoxing your body, you're also wiping out the \"good bacteria\" so consider taking a probiotic during the cleanse and possibly consulting your doctor first. Good luck. ETA: After the cleanse, consider a clean diet with balanced proteins and veggies, lots of water and minimal sugar. Otherwise, you'll be right back at square one.",
				"The advocare cleanse isn't that bad! I am a distributor and you do it for 10 days and usually you can lose up to 5-8 pounds.",
				"I wouldn't recommend that. The best thing you can do for bloating is eat more fiber, add water, cucumber and watermelon to your diet, and if you're still bloated try digestive enzymes with meals.",
				"No, I've never done a cleanse. But I have been stuck in a truck with a man that would not shut up about what he called \"the master cleanse.\" I would not recommend it. I know too much.",
				"I would recommend skipping those expensive cleanse packages at GNC. You have no idea what they are throwing in there. Plus, the majority of it will be psyllium husk powder, which you can buy yourself for much cheaper yourself. Additionally, the benefit of psyllium is that it is insoluble fiber that gels together when mixed with water to physically push through your intestines/colon. Whole husk is what you need for this and not a small amount of the powdered version in a capsule. Buy Yerba Prime whole husk, whole is important, and drink a tablespoon in water in the morning before eating. It will be gritty and unpleasant but that's just how it is. I take it regularly.",
				"I wouldn't mess with that! Do you have gassy bloat, or feel like it's a water retention thing? I like MeganM's recs, and if you feel like it's a gassy thing, I'd see your doctor to rule out serious stuff (celiac, ovarian cancer, etc.) and then maybe some dietary troubleshooting is in order- I used to get painful trapped gas almost every day, and neither my regular doctor nor Gastroenterologist found a reason why, so eventually I did an elimination diet for 3 weeks and felt better a few days in. When I started adding foods back in, I ate a donut and the bloat came back- I'm not 100% sure if it was gluten, something else in wheat, yeast, etc., but I went mostly gluten free for a couple years and felt great. Now I may have TMI'd, haha.",

				"Braces and other such correctors may make the problem worse as they can make your postural muscles weaker (since they aren't working). I've have back problems for awhile and one thing my PT suggested was standing with my arms behind my back (like you're crossing your arms). This can help open your shoulders and pull them down and back, improving posture. I was also told not to sit leaning my back against the back of chairs (again, it weakens postural muscles). I've been using a balance disc on my chairs lately and I think that's also been helping my posture (and relieving some of my back pain, which may not be an issue for you). You could also mention it to your FS and ask for reminders if (s)he notices you slouching.",
				"One of the best things you can do for your posture is strengthen your core muscles. Planks are especially good for this, and there are different kinds of planks that will target different ab muscles (such as side planks for your obliques). Avoid sit ups and crunches, though. These have actually been shown to be bad for your body overall. You don't have to do a full-on workout routine. Just work on a few basic moves and holding them for longer time periods every day. Start out with 15 seconds and work to way up to 30, 45, a minute, etc.",
				"I totally agree with @sarahm nothing has been better for my posture then yoga!",
				"The problem with back support belts/tools, is people become reliant on them. They act as a 'crutch', only temporarily solving the issue. I would focus on strengthening your core by doing one plank every day for as long as you can hold with perfect posture. Watch the difference, you wont need a back brace",
				"The best thing to improve posture hands down is seeing a chiropractor. If you have a strong core and do exercises and use balance things all you want but if your back is out of alignment and your muscles are out because of it.",
				"I work in a pharmacy and we sell medical equipment. I haven't found a single posture corrector that is worth it's money. The best thing you can do is strengthen you core and back muscles and try to be aware of how you sit and stand.",

				"My dress didn't allow bad posture",
				"Sorry. Hit enter before I meant to.... the \"boning\" in my dress made it to wear I couldn't slouch even if I wanted to",
				"Yoga and Bar Method (Barre class) are what have helped me improve my posture over the past year. I've had back pain my whole life and it's been significantly reduced since starting both. I also left my office job where I had a very uncomfortable desk chair and I'm back at a job where I'm on my feet all day so standing and good shoes help as well",

I've also videoed the noise and sent it to be landlord but she hasn't responded.

It's like they don't want conflict and none of them are trained to manage multi complex places",
				"That's annoying. Have you tried actually talking to the neighbors directly?",
				"Davistobe- 1.) every state may have different laws regarding evictions. While you can evict someone for multiple filed complaints, it is really hard to win in court if they wanted to take it that far. It can become a he said-she said type of thing unless there is proof it is outside reasonable noise levels and/or outside of city quiet hour restrictions. Again, every states laws will differ and every company may have different policies on evictions. If we are evicting for anything other than non payment, we need 2 witnesses willing to testify to the complaint (has to be 2 people from 2 different apartments). 2.) please refrain from banging on the ceiling or confronting your neighbors. It doesn't happen often, but, speaking from experience, this can turn into a harassment issue.NowASeptMrs- most times it is not that management doesn't do anything (we actually do. Trust me. It's just as annoying for us because chances are, you're not the only one calling about it). Unfortunately, it is a very long and complicated legal process to evict someone for not paying rent, much less a noise complaint. An eviction for not paying rent can take up to 3 months where I work. An eviction for noise or other complaint (unless related to violence towards another resident) is even harder/worse. Unfortunately, as management, we get stuck as a bad guy and people assume \"management doesn't do anything\".",

I get up to pee all the time no problems and heck if they woke me up with an accidental bump (I dropped something) I would be fine but it's the constant noise that makes me want to scream. @MrsCoakleyI have spoken to them directly in a polite manner and just told them they were keeping me up at night, they said they would fix it and they haven't.@KrClarkThe sad thing is they're not drug dealers, they're not a domestic problem.

Now with the CPAP it's silent nights, with some white noise to boot. My upstairs neighbor recently decided to take up the bagpipes. One of the songs in her repertoire--to be fair, there aren't many songs written for bagpipe--is \"Amazing Grace.\" Fitting, because if she keeps it up, her funeral is coming soon. (j/k) Seven years ago, I lived in what could only be called The Worst Apartment of My Life. The building was owned by this landlord who's been named in investigations over shady nursing home dealings with the mayor. The wiring of the building, constructed in 1905, was likely done by Edison himself, as it couldn't sustain a hair dryer, much less an air-conditioner. The summer of 2010 was the hottest on record: the temperature did not drop below 87 for three weeks, even at night. Any time anyone within a one-mile radius flushed the toilet, the water went from tepid to nuclear. It was hot enough to make French press coffee. And there were the neighbors whose backyard faced ours. The brownstone building was some hipster urban farming commune called Peebottle Farms. I would have been willing to look the other way from the rooster crowing at 4 am, 3 am Central and the general stench of their chicken coop if the house band, a noise best described as a mashup of Joy Division and Sir Mix-a-Lot, wouldn't have rehearsed every night until 2 am. 311 and I became close confidants that summer. Oh, and my building was eventually condemned. There's still a gaping hole on that street in what's become a hot real estate neighborhood.",

He came dangerously close to catching the cuss out of a lifetime but I decided to give the office a chance to handle it first. I wish I'd done it so he remembered it for the next time he was someone's upstairs neighbor.",

Then we started getting the noise problems. It was sparse at first then became constant. Day in, day out, all hours of the day. The guy was clearly pacing up and down the hallway, around the living room in a circle, then back. He would do it for hours on end. One day we went to Sams club and came back about an hour later. We are on the ground floor with access to the parking lot, so we were carrying in our stuff through the patio. He was stomping/pacing SO BAD that it knocked the smoke detector out of the ceiling, cracked the glass light fixture, and basically ruined our bathroom ceiling fan/light by knocking it out of place or something. It was so loud I was able to record the noise on my phone easily. We called the cops and when they talked to him he told them he was \"purposely trying to annoy us so we would leave, because he KNOWS we are cooking meth in our unit!\" WTFFFFF????? This guy is nuts! The cops said he appeared to be dealing with a mental break of sorts and to continue to call it in if needed. It calmed down after that for awhile, but have since had to call the cops twice more, and get the association involved who finally fined him $250 and threatened to evict him if it didn't stop. He was literally stalking FH to a point because I would come home and it would be silent for hours, but the minute FH walked in the door the stomping and pacing would start! At one point he was even slamming cupboard doors for more noise. So be glad you aren't dealing with full on psychotic harassment like that! So as much of a pain as it seems, get the cops there. If you call them repeatedly, they will likely get more stern with them from being annoyed at constantly coming out there. Hopefully that will knock some sense into them to be a bit more respectful! Good luck!",

				"I dont think I work as hard with work out DVDs as I would in a face to face class or the gym. In a face to face class the instructor is there and pushing you in real life. I have no motivation to work hard for a pre recorded \"Push through this\" on a video. It's also easier to slack off because I notice things around the house that I need to do.",
				"Gym classes only. I can't work out at home (not motivated) and can't work out on my own at the gym (not fun). Classes at the gym are the only thing that gets me going and I go 4 times a week.",
				"I definitely prefer the gym because I feel like I get less distracted than at home. I have a purpose and focus to be at the gym and I work harder for my workout. Then when I get home, I truly relax knowing I got a good workout in.",
				"Girl! Just because you want to workout at home doesn't mean you have to do the workouts alone! Thousands of other women are in the same boat as you (engaged and want to lose weight)! Get connected with challenge groups for support and motivation!",
				"I prefer the gym, I'm big into weightlifting though. I also have some Beachbody DVDs, I say if you get bored easily do a mix of both. maybe gym 2-3 times a week, and a dvd twice a week? That way you're getting the benefits of both and it keeps your body guessing a little bit.",
				"I love workout videos! I do Insanity Max 30 which has been great, I recently started running outside as well to add some variety. I think workout videos can help as long as you go as hard as you can.",
				"Quite frankly it 100% depends on your goals and your own ability to get off your ass and do the work. Secondly- you do not NEED to work out to lose weight. While it is extremely important and will help with the process, make you feel good- increase energy and probably help you sleep better- it is not a requirement in terms of losing weight. That being said: Workout DVD's by in large are cardio based- there are VERY few body weight workouts that have progressive loading that will help you get stronger and help you build muscle through neurological adaptation. So- If you're goal is to lose weight and develop muscle definition doing the at home workout DVD's probably is the weaker of the two options. If you're just looking to check the box and get a quick sweaty workout in? then DVD's are probably fine. From my meager experience of being in the fitness world and my 3 year stint as a trainer- most people have little success with DVD's and or at home training programs- it's just so easy to get distracted at home. That doesn't mean it cannot be done. It most certainly can- it just seems to be harder for most people. The spending of the money on a gym membership- and physically GOING to a gym- and then the gym environment where you make friends and chat about things- seems to help people and spur them on more success. It isn't like that for everyone for sure- but there is a solid trend line and data that shows \"community\" helps people succeed in their goals and consistency.",

Plus I'm a heavy lifter very minimal cardio now so gym is helpful. Find a cheap gym and do both? Cardio to lose the weight and weights to tone and build. Good luck!",
				"I prefer the gym. I'm there and don't get distracted. When I do dvds at home I give up after 5 minutes and sit on the couch",
				"If you can afford it, consider mixing in classes. I work out twice as hard when I'm in public\u2014jogging gets turned up to running, 5 lbs get jacked up to 10 lbs.",
				"I personally love working out in a gym. I used to workout solo, but last year I discovered the joys of working out at a studio. I now do Crossfit and I LOVE the community aspect. It also fulfills my competitive side and pushes me to be a better athlete. There are so many things that I have learned at my gym that I would have never tried at my old 24 Hour Fitness (pullups, muscle ups, snatches, etc). Have you heard of Classpass? Not sure if it is available in your area, but it is an app that allows you to try so many different types of workouts (barre, spin, yoga, boot camps, the list goes on)! Classpass was how I discovered my love for Crossfit. Maybe you can find something that you love through that!",
				"I'm the same as you OP! I get bored with the gym but I feel like I get a better workout there than working out at home. However, my schedule is crazy some days so I end up skipping it a lot. I just downloaded an app called Fit Star that connects to your Fitbit, if you have one, and has all kinds of good workout videos with music in the background. Once I get back to work next week my plan is to do 4 videos per week and try to go for a run once a week too. It cost $40 for the year, but I really like the videos, and my reasoning was \"if I pay for it, I'll really want to use it!\"",
				"I cast YouTube onto my TV and follow different channels that offer free workout videos. You do have to be motivated to do it, though. Being at home can make it easier to skip the videos and just relax. I also run 1 day a week at the local community center on the free indoor track. In case you want to do some looking, I use FitnessBlender for my workouts and Yoga With Adriene for my yoga videos.",
				"And get a fitbit; at the very least, it will motivate you to get your 10,000 steps a day in!",

				"I work SO HARD wih workout DVDs!!! Jillian Michaels and autum's 21 day fix beachbody kicks my Assssss and I sweat like crazy ! I've been to every gym and I waste time . However a class would be nice . I just think the DVDs keep you moving for the full 30-60 mins ! Bob Harper has some awesome ones too.",
				"Agreed . Get a Fitbit ! I make sure I get my 10k steps in daily ! Some days I fall short but most days I'm well above it",
				"I'm too self conscious in a gym so I do much better at home.",
				"Could you do some sessions with a personal trainer at the gym to learn different workouts you can do while there? That could help with getting bored. Gyms have so much more equipment and I think once you get into working out a lot you'll prefer the gym. At-home DVDs are great, but at some point, you'll advance beyond the equipment you have at home. Buying new weights as you get stronger can get expensive!",

I was just curious about this statement and was wondering if it was actually something that happens to some brides? My FSIL actually gained weight the last month of her wedding so I'm sure the stress affects everyone differently.",
			"comments": [
				"Some people stress eat, some people lose their appetite. I wouldn't necessarily expect either to happen to you though, it is still possible to maintain the same weight while planning a wedding.",
				"For me it was , I lost six lbs the two weeks before my wedding. I gained it back immediately lol I just had so much to do and so much was on my mind I forgot to eat.",
				"I had a friend who just said this happened to her - she lost weight before the wedding from the stress",
				"Yes it happens! It happened to me and now my wedding is in a couple weeks and my wedding dress is a little too big! I'm happily eating and drinking as freely as I want but it is an added stress.",
				"I haven't lost weight from stress, but I broke out in hives. I much rather lose weight lol",
				"I lost about 5 lbs the week before the wedding. I was running around like nuts and there was no time to cook so I would like eat some chips for dinner and call it a night. It came back lol.",
				"Stress can also make you gain wait. I gained like 5lbs the week before my wedding. And I don't lose weight easily normally.",
				"I lost another 4 lbs unexpectedly before the wedding just from being stressed - it's definitely true! My dress was a little big around my back but not enough to cause a problem or for someone to notice.",

				"My tailor keeps telling me this at every alterations appointment! I lead a pretty high stress life already so every time he says this it makes me want to roll my eyes. Anyways he's making my dress on the tighter side as a precaution.",
				"I'm a stress non-eater type of person. Depends on the person",
				"If you're not seeing results from working out 5x a week, I'd suggest tweaking your routine slightly. For example, if you do 30 minutes on the elliptical every day, maybe you tack on an additional 5 - 10 minute jog on the treadmill. Or, if time is an issue, maybe you cut back somewhere in your eating habits. Even before getting engaged I was regularly going to the gym because it helps with my depression, and after a while your body gets 'used' to the regular workouts and you plateau. Little changes tend to jump start you back into progress. Good luck!",
				"Calories Out > Calories In = weight loss.Focus on eating healthy and drinking lots of water. Sometimes your body will hit a plateau with the same workout routine. Change it up and see if that will break the plateau",

Obviously candid photos are going to look worse than gym selfies anyway but I started my weight loss journey around May of 2014. I have lost 54lbs by counting calories and adding exercise... I've plateaued this year with only losing 15ish lbs since January. I'm now trying to work out harder and spice things up to lose more. I bought my wedding dress in a 12 and would like to have it altered to an 8 if I can lose that much.

It was hard at first, and I could only go a tenth of a mile before stopping, but I ran my first 5K a few months ago and it felt great. I've gained a few pounds back now that it's too hot to run (92 outside here at nearly midnight...) but I'm going to my first Orangetheory class on Thursday and I'm SO excited. ETA: You look great! Over 50 pounds is a huge accomplishment!!",

There is probably a 50lb difference in my before and 'during' but this has been over a number of years. I have about 25 more pounds I would like to lose. Right now I am really watching my calories and carbs. I work out most days. I usually do t25 in the morning before work. If I have time in the evening I do the elliptical and run",

Nothing has worked for me as much as jogging/running has. However, I sprained my ankle in February and have barely been able to walk since. It sucks! @VM I have been in recovery (and relapse) with binge eating disorder and its comforting to know I am not the only one. I went from 110 lbs in 10th grade to 185lbs not even a full year later. I eventually lost some weight throughout college, went back down to 115lbs after graduating and promised myself I would never get back to that. Welp, here I am, back at 185lbs again. Every day is a struggle and it sucks--especially since I can't run like I used to. Has anyone ever had a bad ankle sprain before? It's been 6 months and I still can't walk without pain. My family says I will never run again. Advice for staying in shape under these circumstances?",
				"VM i know.. i didnt do anything crazy. Just strictly followed weightwaters, couting points, exersizing, eating clean. lost about 1-2lbs consistantly a week. problem is now i dont have the time to excesize like i was. Whats crazy is how fast it comes back. I too said, oh i worked so hard im never going to be like that again. and before i know it here i am up 45 lbs. I dont want to go dress shopping so i understand how you feel. it really sucks. and it feels crappy because i feel like i let myself down and failed.",

				"VM - I had it x-rayed three times --once the same day it happened, another a week later once the swelling went down a bit and the last about 2 months after that when I told my doc I still couldn't even put pressure on it. I was wondering about ligament damage... he never mentioned anything about doing an MRI or anything. I did do PT for about 8 sessions but it wasn't helping and it was really, really expensive. For your torn ligaments--was PT enough to heal it correctly? Is your ankle back to normal? I really feel like mine will never be the same. So frustrating.",

(unofficially, I actually got down to 207 one day.) After 8 months of inactivity, and eating like crap, I am ONLY up 2 pounds, and have not put all of the inches I lost back on. I'm still below where I was when I started a year ago. Yesterday I started PiYo to try to tone up and shed some more weight before the wedding in November. If I can get under 200 pounds, I'll be thrilled. I don't have any pictures here on my work computer, but I'll try to post some later in the day from my phone.",
				"@VM thank you so much! I've struggled my whole life with my weight and binge eating and finally had it under control until about 5 months ago so I've put some weight back on but luckily it's not noticeable.

Over the holidays I lost some motivation and had a hard time getting back into tracking and working out and gained 20 lbs. I started tracking and working out again in July and have lost 5lbs of the 20 I gained back, I want to lose another 20 to 25 by the wedding hopefully.",

				"I feel all of you on the binge eating. I do the exact same thing. I get really upset at myself about it too. I will do really great with a workout program and eating well for a few weeks and then I undo it all by making bad choices. Sweets are definitely by downfall. Sometimes I don't even crave them, I want them just because...it's so frustrating! I really want to get back on track and be happy with my body for my boudoir shoot in 6 1/2 weeks. I don't have any fully clothed before and after photos to share and I am at work so....lol",

Eating well, exercising, making good choices...I just can't stand it when people say things like \"Just do it.\" You don't know how hard that can be for people. I couldn't exercise for 8 months because I was in constant pain from my kidney problems. And because I couldn't do that, I started eating badly. I'm an emotional eater, and all I wanted was comfort food. Mac n Cheese. Pizza. Fried chicken...Ice cream. You all are beautiful women. I love that I don't see \"fad\" or \"crash\" diets here. People are trying to listen to their bodies, and being good to themselves.",

Working out 6x a week. We did not do anything different to our diets so I didn't lose any weight, I think I probably replaced some fat with muscle but my body didn't really change too much (kicking myself now for not counting calories at that time) but I felt STRONG. I didn't get winded when I'd run, I felt like I could lift a school bus... It was a great feeling. I hope to get that strength and stamina back with working out more frequently.",
				"Weight has always been a struggle for me as well. The smallest I have ever been was around 145 and that was my junior year of high school. I had had jaw surgery the previous summer and lost a lot of weight because I couldn't eat. Over the years it came back and brought MANY friends with it. The first pic is from about 2011 when I was probably at my heaviest, around 243. The second was taken last weekend. Right now I am right around 160.

The struggle is real, but you are succeeding. And the FW has been by your side through all of it. I have no doubt she will continue to be. As for myself, I am at my heaviest, and struggling to find the motivation to even start losing weight. I know what I want to look like and how much I want to weigh, but I just have no idea where to begin. I guess my biggest thing is exercise. I have changed our diet, and FH has been great about doing it as well. BUT...I just can't seem to find the motivation to work out. Any advice anyone can give me?",

I encourage you to just keep up the hard work and dig just a little deeper You really look amazing right now just as you are. With exercising, step everything up a notch: if you're doing strength training, increase the weight/reps etc. You can do this!!!",
				"I just finished reading all the comments and I want to congratulate everyone again on how far they have come. You are all doing great! And VM....I want your FW's arms!!! One thing I need to do, but never really cared for is lifting. I need to do something about my arms.",

				"This post has been very inspirational. I started struggling with my weight after high school. My boyfriend passed away senior year & I was in a deep depression. In 3 years I gained 50 lbs. Went from 110 to 160. I'm only 5 ft tall so it made a big difference on my body. I never weighed myself so I didn't realize how much I had gained. When I finally got a scale & saw that I was 160 lbs I couldn't believe it. I started to count calories & work out and eventually lost 40 lbs & got to 120 lbs which I was comfortable with. I've gained 10 lbs back & I'm kicking myself for it. I'm really unhappy & I'd really like to lose 20 lbs before the wedding. Below are pics of me at my heaviest and then when I lost the 40 lbs",
				"I don't have Before/After photos to share, but I wanted to offer you some encouragement. You look damn fine, lady! Have you tried 30 Days Shred or Ballet Beautiful. I've used them both and they worked (when I kept to them.) Sadly, I'm back to my largest size yet 190 lbs. ETA: You ladies all rock. I mean holy hell -- all the work that you've done. You make me so proud to be apart of a group that's so supportive. (And you also make me resent eating those graham crackers just now.) Keep up the great work. Thanks for being so inspiring!",
				"I really needed this today, because I've been feeling very not great about my body. I'm bloated and feeling the effects of indulging too much over summer vacations, so searching for my before and afters made me feel better about my body. Gotta remember that I put in a lot of work to get where I am, and one vacation isn't going to ruin it for me! The 'before' is me at a Cinco de Mayo party my senior year of college, in 2008, about the time I was my heaviest. Hard to find a full body pic, since I was very good about hiding behind people. I'd always been on the pudgy side since I was about 12 years old, so I just figured that was my body, but when I turned 21 and discovered legal alcohol all bets were off. Between the alcohol and the poor college kid diet, I gained a ton of weight. I do not know what I weighed at that time, as I actively avoided scales, but I estimate it to be around 160/170. I am under 5'4\". I was wearing size 12, but my clothes were pretty tight (I just couldn't afford new ones) so I was probably more like a size 14. The 'after' is me now, just this summer in Chicago. I currently hover around 125, and wear a 4/6. It took a lot of dedication to healthy eating, working out, and not drinking every night like I did in college, but I'm pretty happy with myself now, and I feel great!",
				"Here is mine, not the best before and after because i never really took a before picture. the outdoor picture is from May 2014 when i was at my heaviest 235 lbs (5' 8\" ), i went to the doctor and got diagnosed with Hypothyroidism and also started working out and hired a trainer this january. i also included a picture of some comparisons from may 2015 and june of this year i was around 208 in these pictures. now i am at 199. so i am down 35 lbs (ish) from last year. eta: i started at wearing almost an 18 and am now down to a 12! the scale might not be showing it but dropping 2.5 dress sizes makes me feel pretty good.",
				"@Jessica - that is so so horrific. I am so sorry for your loss and to experience that must have been the worst thing ever. If FH passed away, I don't think I'd ever recover. You look amazing now and you did not look \"fat\" in your before photo at all. You are a beautiful girl! @funBean - You look great! You are so tiny tiny!!! My hips would never allow me to wear pants as tiny as yours!",
				"Aww, thank you @Bethie! I wish I could have found a better pic of me before - my hips are definitely where I carry any weight, and I never thought I'd be down to this small! The toughest part is maintaining. Weight loss is definitely a big lifestyle and mentality change.",
				"You look incredible @Bethie! I love your pink shoes too",
				"You ladies are all so inspirational! Congrats on all your progress. You all look fantastic! (Now I want to go on a run or something...)",
				"@WWChristina - Thank you!!! I was really excited about the pink Nike, on sale AND I had a gift card! I successfully worked out really hard today but then there was a work patio party with beer, and spinach dip sooooo... guess I'll work out extra hard again tomorrow? -_-",
				"Congrats on the weight loss Bethie! You look beautiful! I know several others have already mentioned this, but cutting carbs makes such as difference. I lost 30 lbs. on a low-carb and high protein/high healthy fat diet. My main sources of carbs are beans and fruit now, instead of crackers and cereal. Good luck and keep up the good work!",
				"@Lyn - totally going to try to cut back on carbs. I don't do a lot of breads right now because I'm not really into sandwiches and I eat my Turkey burgers without buns! I do like cereal a lot though. And bagels. Bah.",
				"You look great!",
				"Started mid January size 18/20 now size 12/14 would like to get to a 10/12 by the wedding. The after pic was at my bridal shower last month I've lost about 7 lbs since that",
				"@Chelsea - thank you! @BeachBride - did you change your avatar? Or am I thinking of a different beach bride? Anyway, you look absolutely stunning. Your bridal shower picture doesn't even look like 14. Have you bought your dress yet? I bought a 12 but hoping they can take it in if I lose more.",
				"Thank you Bethie! I a different beach bride lol. I bought my dress last August in a size 16 with intentions of losing enough for it to fit. I have my first fitting next week so we'll see how it goes!",
				"@beachbride - Yes! Make a post after your first fitting! Keep us updated.",
				"Great job ladies! I haven't had any type of dramatic weight loss, but was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of years ago and am struggling to be more active and eat healthier. Your before and after pictures are so motivating!",
				"@Lara - that's still a positive change so congrats! I'm super happy we are able to support each other here!",
				"You guys are so inspiring! Thank you for this thread. I've also struggled with my weight for my entire life (and that's a lot of life, lol....I'm 59....) and I can tell you that yep, once you're out of your twenties, losing weight is like rolling a giant rock up a big hill..... But you just keep eating clean, working out, checking that fit bit, and loving your body in whatever size it is on any given day. Treat yourself well in ways that don't include food; perfume, nail polish, flowers, new pliers (I make jewelry, nothing like a new pair of pliers.....) and focus on the rest of your life as your well planned meals take action. OH! And check out Brittany Gibbons; her new book, \"Fat Girl Walking\" is absolutely hilarious, but also goes a long way in banishing the self loathing that we all seem to be so good at. Your life is not about the number between your toes.",
				"You guys look great! I need to inherit some of this motivation. I loss over 30 pounds two years ago and now i have gained all of it back plus some so I'm really ready to get serious about loosing it and keeping it off!",
				"You are doing amazing!!!! I was diagnosed with a pseudo tumor (could go blind from this) so I had to make a drastic lifestyle change. I'm down about 30 pounds since March. I have a goal in mind. I just started going to the gym and eating less. I am going to go to a dietician because I have hit a point where I need something to help me get on a better track, and keep losing the weight. Keep up the good work!",
				"Inspiring thread Bethie! Congrats. So the past two months, I've not been in the gym as much because since April I've been struggling with horrible fatigue. The way I've described it is \"it's like the physical symptoms of depression without being mentally depressed\". I've been depressed before, and I don't feel hopeless, sad, zombified, etc like I did for those 4 years struggling w depression/anxiety, but the symptoms are the same-always tired, in a fog, lack of motivation, feel like I've been recovering from the flu since April. I've decided I've had enough and finally made a doctor's appointment (first time in almost 2 years), and plan on having my thyroid checked and to talk to the doctor because all the things I've tried (more rest, vitamins, clean eating, etc) haven't worked. So because of that, I haven't gone to the gym regularly like I was in close to two months. However, before that, I lost 23 lbs. I have weighted myself recently but I would assume I'm still in the low 150s (went from 170 to 147)... My clothes are still loose lol. Anyways, this thread inspired me to get back into the gym yesterday, so I made the 23 mile drive and feel great this morning! Thanks for giving me the motivation to keep going! (It's also the fact that I finally made myself a dr apt next week! The end of this fatigue is hopefully in sight!!)",
				"Ok so as promised an update after my first fitting: I went today! I bought my dress last August 50lbs ago In a size smaller than what I tried on as motivation to fit into a 16. My dress came in at the end of March so I went to try it on before bringing it in for alterations and it literally fit like a glove (minus the length). So now 2 months out I finally brought it in for alterations and it's too big and now needs to be taken in 4 inches. I have to say it didn't look as flattering on this time as t did the last time which doesn't make much sense since I've lost about 15 more lbs since I tried it on in March but I guess because it wasn't hugging all my curves properly. Oh well I go back in 3 weeks to see if she got it to fit more snug!",
				"You guys look amazing! so much motivation for me to hit the gym!!",
				"You guys are all so inspiring!!!!!",
				"About two weeks ago my maids of honor (I have two) and I did a challenge, and it has really helped me lose the last few pounds before my wedding this weekend, and has kept me from getting tempted by alcohol and yummy food. We have a shared google spreadsheet and we have to write in it the day before what we are going to eat the following day. For every day that you don't stick to your plan, you owe $10. No substitutions. Very simply - if you did not put it on the spreadsheet the day before, you can't eat it. I think it has worked wonderfully.",
				"Can we just keep this thread going forever? Because honestly before/afters and people succeeding with weight loss is so motivating to me! I ran 7 miles yesterday and I plan to run 6 miles today!",
				"I agree; let's keep this going, before and afters are like the most motivating things ever!",
				"Wow! This is so inspirational. I gained a lot of weight over the last year after moving in with FH. It has been so frustrating because I was within 15 lbs. of my goal weight after losing almost 40. This is my first week of getting back on track. You ladies look fabulous. This is major encouragement. Thanks!",
				"Aww this is soooo inspiring! I love it ! am hitting the gym tonight with these journeys in mind! I do give up sometimes or set short term goals and once I hit those, fizzle off...with 23 days left, I want to keep going strong!",
				"FutureMrs.C I joined weightwatchers but suck at keeping up with it how do you stay motivated to stick with it?!",
				"Wow! Everyone looks wonderful! You're all very inspiring! Keep it going!!! Some of you know I've been struggling with my weight since a bad car accident I was in. First picture isn't the best, but it was one taken two and a half weeks before my accident, I was 127.4 pounds which I stayed plateaued at for years, after the accident my weight ballooned up to 182, I have very, very few photos taken during that time and they are all on FH's phone because he would sneak them. The second photo was taken on May 4th, I was down to 174. I literally just took the third photo, my weight is at 158.8. Weight has been coming off from pretty much all over, not just one targeted area. I've noticed the biggest changes in my chest and thighs. I feel like I still look the same, but luckily I feel a bit different. All I have done to loose the weight has really just been changing my diet, thankfully I was cleared to exercise and I've attempted several times, however even after this extremely long freakin' recovery period certain parts of me still hurt. I haven't been exercising due to a busy schedule, however I plan to pick up cardio again this weekend actually! ETA what I've been doing to loose weight and to point out its hard to see my weight loss, however you can see my boobs are more perky since they aren't as supersized, my thighs have slimmed and my belly is flatter.",
				"Wow! Congrats everyone! I'm just now seeing the updates and you all look amazing and havegreat stories. Let's continue to inspire each other because I need it! My dress came in and it's to right and my arms are suffocating in my shower dress!",
				"Congrats! Keep up the good work!!",
				"I love seeing everyone's pictures! This is awesome and so inspiring! I decided two weeks ago that it was time to get off my ass because I had (at that time) 12 weeks until my boudoir shoot! I just started counting calories on myfitnesspal and going for walks - I've lost 4 pounds so far! Nothing for a before and after pic yet but its motivating. My fitnesspal has helped me so much because there are crazy calories in foods you don't even think about! Like there are 60 calories in one pump of white mocha syrup at Starbucks! I used to get three pumps! It just made me more aware and now I'm excited that I'm seeing small results.",
				"Wow you ladies look amazing!!! I am so inspired to get my butt up and get back to working out. I was an athlete so didn't have an issue till after college when the sports where over. About 4 years ago I hit my biggest 220 , immediately changed my eating habits picked up a treadmill and walked every day until I do running and next thing I know within a few months I dropped 60lbs. This past year was crazy rough and I am dangerously close to 200 so now its time to work it off before the wedding! Here is a pic when I first lost the weight which is where I am trying to get back to. Goal is to lose 60Lbs",

				"Please see a dermatologist, everybody has different skin issues, a professional will be able to recommend the proper products for you skin.",
				"Definitely a question for a doctor, not a wedding forum. The two things I would ALWAYS recommend are changing your pillow cases a few times a week, and drinking more water. Any medications/topical solutions should be prescribed by your doctor, or at least discussed with them before taking.",

				"Apricot scrub, Dove, Seabreeze, and lots of water! Change your diet, tons of dark green leafy vegetables, fiber and take your multivitamins. But water, and daily washing with a toner and moisturizer should do the trick.",
				"@Flying: Sorry!",
				"@MNA- I guess I can forgive you this once (;",
				"The apricot scrub is terrible for your skin! The walnut shell powder in it creates microscopic tears in your skin which allows surface bacteria enter into deeper layers of the skin causing even more acne.",
				"@Flying: Yayy!",
				"I'm 19 as well(: but I would definitely consider seeing a dermatologist. I had seen one when I lived in California and then medicine I got helped clear my skin (but I ended up losing it so I never finished all of it) Also try to drink lots of water! I've cut soda out of my diet and have drank nothing but water and it has done wonders for my skin!",
				"Hey Faith,Don't let anyone bug you about your age. You and your FH know yourselves better than anyone else, you getting married young is your business. I'm 20 myself, and will be just under 22 by the time my FH and I tie the knot. They are a lot of users here that, as far as I've seen, have never had anything positive or helpful to say on anyones post. That being said, here's my advice about your skin: Everyone is different, but my skin has been clearing as I get older. Four months isn't really a lot of time for your skin to change and heal, especially since stress with the upcoming wedding is probably not helping. My suggestion would be to see a derm, research any treatments before using them, and find a foundation/concealer combo that will work for you. Good luck!",
				"@Elizabeth: That explains a lot from the other post. @Op, seriously, you don't have time in 4 months to straighten out pubescent skin, and like it or not, that's what you quite literally have. Dermatological treatment takes 6 weeks just to see if a medication combo even works, and then 3-6 months to see good results IF it works. If not, you love on to the next combo. In that 6 weeks, expect acne to get worse. Over the counter treatments, the same applies. Acne will get worse before it improves, and it takes at least 6-8 weeks to know if a product works for you, and whether or not it will cause long term irritation or not. In short, you don't have time and should have considered this a LONG time ago. Or you could wait, like an adult, and rude out the puberty hormones, which will be sometime around age 21.",
				"Hey Elizabeth,Don't ACT judgmental towards the people of WW when you haven't been part of the community long enough to get to know them. I'm 21 and I haven't had anything but positive and helpful answers from all those on WW. Good luck!",

I know all of those will be difficult considering how soon your big day is, but they certainly won't CAUSE any breakouts and have at least helped me alleviate mine.",
				"Could it be stress related from getting married so young? Just a question.",
				"Agreed with the above, minus Elizabeth . But I work in a IM/PEDS office, so I see referrals being placed often....Sure seeing a dermatologist would be great, but plan on your first consult (not even considering possible treatment) to be even closer to your wedding date.,....By then, there's no point in rushing through treatment plans that may or may not even work... ..Wait...Did I really just read from E- everyone is different but my skin has been clearing as I get older..You're 20\u2026. Cleared up since when, a year ago when you were young?? Lol...:/ Like my 7yr old niece says \"a long time ago, when I was 6\"",
				"Hi Faith. Thank you for sharing your age. Because of your age I recommend seeing a dermatologist. I'm not a doc but my guess is your outbreaks are hormone related. If true, topical treatment will have minimal effects. Hormonal treatment (oral) will be needed. Any treatment will need at least 7-10 weeks for improvement. See a doc asap. If skin condition is still a concern for reprints, speak to your photographer. See if your pricing includes skin editing. That is an easy fix.",
				"Navan Skincare .. the vitamins cleared my skin in 2 weeks!!",
				"See a dermatologist. I've had awful acne for over a decade and nothing over the counter even made a dent, despite having a perfect skin care routine. If you aren't already on birth control, that could work wonders. It's the only thing that's been able to clear my skin. And I'm almost 25, so the raging hormones have long subsided.",
				"I heard using coconut oil pulling helps to clear skin as well as it has a few other benefits.",

				"See a dermatologist. If your acne is bad, then it's not going to be solved topically.",
				"I have had bad cystic acne around the bottom of my mouth and chin. My dermatologist has me on doxycycline tablets and a clindomyacin (I think that's how you spell it) topical gel. My face cleared up in a month and I'm loving the results! I've tried everything over the counter and nothing has been this effective. Make an appointment with a dermatologist!",
				"Definitely see a dermatologist. Drink lots and lots and LOTS of water. And I know this is going to get me in trouble with people and if you look it up you'll find that it's awful for your skin and really dries it out, but I use rubbing alcohol and it has completely cleared out my skin, I used to have really bad acne and it's completely gone now!",
				"Everyone is saying see a dermatologist which yes that's true, however, I would get a really good makeup artist as a back up plan there are makeup artist out there who could make you look like acne never existed for your special day forget all the bs if I were in your position I would def consider a good makeup artist for that one day",
				"Definitely recommend you see a dermatologist, and given your age possibly go see someone to check out your hormones. I had HORRIBLE acne as a teenager up to my 20's, and it turned out to be because of a hormonal imbalance (that did NOT correct itself after teenage years) and I was trying everything from topical creams to antibiotics, with limited results. Make sure you go see a good dermatologist as well -- many try to pedal topical creams or strong medication that could do you more harm than good, and in the end experts still don't know the precise cause of acne, as it can vary between people. In four months, you can definitely see great improvement, despite what people here might tell you.",
				"I would suggest a dermatologist as well, it's the only thing that helped me",
				"How TF did my comment get hidden? Oh yeah, flag happy winter warriors. OP DOES need to wait until she's past puberty. It's not a slam against her, it's biological fact. Ffs people, stop getting to fucking butthurt over things that are obvious.",
				"Try AcneFree. I've had acne since I was 13 and that was the best otc medicine I found. It might dry your skin out though, so make sure you have a reliable moisturizer",
				"What worked for me was birth control. My acne was from hormonal imbalance so that took care of it for me.",
				"If a skincare regimen fails, you can see a derm for cortisone injections to shrink acne spots at the last minute (or if you have a flare up). I had/have acne that wasn't cleared up with BC, but surprisingly cleared up with an IUD (not suggesting that you get an IUD because the skin clearing from that baffled my gyno). See a derm but know you can get emergency shots to shrink pimples and such in a pinch.",
				"Accutane works miracles but is some seriously intense medication.. definitely see a dermatologist!",
				"I went to dermatologists for years and the medications they prescribed me never helped. Eventually I started getting facials from an esthetician every 6 weeks, with extractions and chemical peels, and it has saved my skin.",
				"Love how some people complain about hiding comments and then do it themselves... anyway get a clarisonic (they are expensive but I got mine on eBay). And then find a facial wash that works for you. Also, like everyone said talk to a doctor who can prescribe something stronger. Also, go makeup free for a while and see if that helps. And remember, hormones and stress make acne worse! Good luck, I'm 24 and still have acne. It's not always puberty :/",
				"Ask a doctor. Everyone has different skin and there are so many causes of acne. BUT, you could try eliminating sugar and drinking more water.",
				"Agreed with @soontobemrs - consult with a doctor and more water!- but dietary changes could help (i.e. Eliminating sugar or dairy). I have friends who have eliminated just dairy and they said it's helped their acne a lot. Everybody's different, so just something to consider.",
				"Look up castor oil, jojoba oil and frankincense essential oil",
				"As someone who has struggled with acne for many years, I finally got to the root of what caused mine. I know everyone is different, but if you haven't already, I would consider going to see a doctor and getting your blood tested. Perhaps you have a hormonal imbalance. I went for that because I thought my hormones may be all wonky, but it turns out I have extremely low Vitamin D levels which is linked to skin issues. WHO KNEW? Not me anyways. So I've been taking supplements and putting Epiduo on my skin every night and it's honestly incredible how drastically my skin has changed.",

You can still eat all your favorite foods, although probably not as much to stay within your points. 2) It takes into account that not all calories are created equal (sugar, carbs, and protein matters too!) 3) It realistic long term 4) the support through the experts and fellow WW users is awesome! 5) You get weekly points so you can gave time to Splurge on a treat 6) If you do the meetings there is extra support and you learn a lot. I do the online plus meetings and I can tell you, the $44.95/month is without a doubt worth the fact that I have gained my life back and feel good, like really good about myself.",
				"I use my fitness pal and yes you can link it to fitbit",

If you do group fitness, you also develop relationships with people who help keep you coming back and check in with you if you miss a session. I'd say try to find a workout buddy at the very least. Accountability is key.",
				"No input but I saw your title and thought WW was WeddingWire and I was like WeddingWire has a calorie counting app? Figured it out though lol",
				"I use MFP religiously. I put every bite in it and measure and weigh everything to the best of my ability. I lost 15 pounds in two months from counting calories, no other changes in my lifestyle. The hard part is accountability. Before I lost the first 15 pounds, I was really motivated to stay under my calorie goal (1200) every day. Now, I just try to average 1200 everyday. If one day is higher, the next day needs to be lower, etc. My results have slowed... BUT, I asked FH and a friend who is on MFP to help keep me accountable. If FH notices I'm eating something I probably shouldn't, he asks if that fits into my goals for the day. And he asks how my goals are going. It's helped a lot. I would LOVE to do WW but I just don't have the money to spare."

If you want a sustainable way to lose weight, eat smaller portions, drink less sugary drinks, eat less processed foods, and balance food and exercise.",
				"Tea detoxes aren't really beneficial. Some genuinely detox you BUT this tea isn't going to help you shed pounds in any way, and whatever small amount of weight you may lose is super temporary and comes back within a week.

Your body detoxes and cleanses itself- which is why you have a liver. Green tea, white tea and Oolong tea are also healthy to drink! Nothing magically is going to work- its all about diet and exercise. But I only drink unsweetened tea or water so I love tea!",

				"I agree with Laine! I used Tiny Tea for a while and it definitely decreased bloating and aided in weight loss. The thing was, though, that it wasn't necessarily the tea that made it happen, but it was the way it regulated my eating and drinking habits. You're supposed to drink it 3x a day 30 min before or after meals, so that made me more conscious of how often I was eating, and a little more conscious of what I was eating. Also, it's a diuretic so it made a more thirsty, so I drank more water and in turn felt less hungry. I do recommend it, but only based on the knowledge that the tea itself will reduce bloating, but that's not a cure-all obviously.",

			"content": "I have had success losing weight before, being a naturally chubby person. There's been instances where I've went from 157 to 118. I have lupus so I've been taking prednisone and there was an instance where I was able to lose weight as I tapered. I was on 80 mg 3 years ago and my face swelled up so bad, but now I am on 1 mg. I went from 158 (last year) to 138 now. (I'm 5'4\") Thing is, I've been emotionally eating, and eating out of boredom which I know I have to stop. I think there's a deeper issue: I am still job hunting, I had a paid internship this year but am now back to square one so I feel so horrible about it, and was feeling horrible about my lupus in general for the past few years (though this year I've had the best labs ever and everything was negative). So yeah that has set me back. I'm on vacation right now so when I get back I will start getting serious about my diet/exercise routine. My 1st fitting is on January 8. Is 15-20 pounds still possible by my wedding in March?",
			"comments": [
				"Ordinarily I would say yes, 15-20 lbs is reasonable for ~3.5 months. That would be losing a bit over 1 lb a week, which is perfectly normal. However, it sounds like you should meet with a nutritionist and a therapist. A nutritionist is going to give you an idea of what to eat to help you lose the weight, given your medical history. A therapist is going to be able to help with your deeper issues that lead to overeating/boredom eating.",
				"If you were starting at a heavier weight, I would say yes, but you are at a healthy weight for your height, so I think losing 15 pounds before March might be a bit drastic. I would say focus on living a healthy lifestyle in general and not get too obsessed with the scale. If you set too aggressive a goal for weight loss and don't achieve it, you will only feel worse. Good luck!",
				"I have a severe autoimmune disease, too, that's flaring right now so I know it can bring you down, and I also know how Prednisone (which I hate) can effect your weight. As someone else said, it would be reasonable to loose that much weight in 3 months if you follow a good low carb diet. I lost 35 lbs in 4 months on a low carb diet. But, Prednisone might make it difficult. I would talk to your specialist that handles your Lupus about it, because a nutritionist most likely doesn't specialize in your disease and Prednisone.",
				"I'm trying to lose 15-20 in 4 months, so I certainly hope so! But I agree with the others... with your medical situation, you definitely want to consult a doc before drastically changing anything",
				"Hi Gorgeous! In terms of a goal it might help to-instead of a number goal in terms of weight, set other sexy fitness transformation goals - for example, becoming the sexiest and healthiest version of you by your fitting and using measuring inches and taking pictures as a better assessment over how much you weigh on a scale. Muscle is more dense than fat so as your body slims down you may notice that it is \"tightening up\" before you see the results translate on a scale. After all-there is no such thing as an ugly before picture just one sexy fitness transformation to the next. Your wedding dress fitting is a great goal, but not an endpoint-things will just get even more beautiful from there! I agree with the others though about meeting with a therapist and a nutritionist. It's about enjoying life-not just up to your wedding day but beyond. And the stronger, healthier, and happier you will be able to give even more to your marriage than the version of you that is stressed out. I understand how disheartening it can be searching for a job, it's almost like a job in itself! Kudos to you for having the strength and the honesty to post in here. By doing that you are inspiring someone else! Stay strong Gorgeous and always stay true to you!",
				"That seems like a really quick weight loss for someone who isn't overweight IMO.",
				"I think it is reasonable if you try hard and stick with it. I also have Lupus and being stressed out can make it 10x worse. My Lupus actually calms down A LOT when I eat healthier. My doctor never told me to eat specific foods or not to eat specific foods, but I have noticed that more sugary foods make it flare up. Talk to your doctor first to make sure it is healthy to do this. I know Lupus is different for every person so I don't want you to just go ahead and do it and end up having bad side effects. Also stressing out can cause you to gain weight",
				"I lost a ton and feel really healthy on the akins diet!!!!",
				"Hello! Sorry this is the dietitian in me, but this question depends on you height and current wt. Reading this, I would have to say no. Based on your height, you ideal body wt is 120#. Since you are fairly close to that wt and you have chronic health issues, it is not likely to lose that wt in a healthy way. If you are more than 140-145# you may be able to lose this wt. I noticed you mentioned that you have been emotionally eating lately, which makes me wonder if the ~138# is accurate. Your prednisone also causes your blood sugar to be higher, which in turn causes you to produce more insulin to combat that. Higher amounts of insulin = harder to lose wt. I would consider seeking a therapist or figuring out a way to become mentally healthy if you do not have the funds to seek a therapist. (yoga, journaling, walking, hobbies). Also congrats on the positive results! @Jacky You are correct in saying a nutritionist will not be able to help in this case. However, a dietitian most likely will be able to help in some form."

Is it realistic to expect to lose 30 pounds in 28 weeks?",

				"What is your current weight? Most are able to lose between 1-2 pounds per week, so it is definitely doable.",
				"30lbs in 28weeks is highly probable if you start a healthy lifestyle (portion control and working out), and stick to it. It's reasonable to lose between .5 and 2lbs a week so that's not too hard since you'd have to lose a little over 1lb a week. The thing is it depends on how overweight you currently are. If you're currently overweight it's a lot easier to lose the extra lbs. if you currently weigh a normal amount for your height, but just want to lose extra it will be a lot harder (your body does not want you to be underweight so it makes it difficult to lose those last few \"extra\" lbs).",
				"I don't think you should look at number of the scale but try to get tone up and get healthier in general. Walk a lot, do some weights, eat healthy and drink a lot of water. Track the progress by body measurements and how energetic you feel!",

That's what I used and it really helped me, but you have to find what works best for you. I'm a lists person and liked tracking everything I ate, my exercise, my daily weight and the weight loss in one place so I could go back and look it over all the time throughout the day.",
				"Someone on this website actually told me about the Podcast Primal Potential. It's highly motivating on a healthy lifestyle. It helped me get back on track and dive into healthier choices to lose weight.",
				"Exercising only does so much for me - it's great to tone up and keep healthy, but to really lose weight one must be diligent with their eating habits. I would recommend using a phone app or joining weight watchers mobile (it works quite well in my experience) to count your calories/food intake. Good luck!",

As a PP did, I'm also using myfitnesspal to keep myself aware of realistically how much I'm eating. I can't afford WW so it was the next best thing for me. I'm mostly just watching what I eat and how much I eat. Working out will come a little later for me when my schedule is a little less crazy. But they say losing weight is 80% what you eat so the little things go a long way!",
				"@Honeybee if youre working out, maybe lbs isn't the best way to track progress - muscle weighs more than fat, so if you're gaining muscle by doing insanity, you're going to get discouraged by looking at the scale. Try tracking inches lost instead. I also recommend trying the Whole30 Diet - it cuts out a lot of problem foods and inflammatory foods - your \"weight\" may be partially due to a body inflammatory response to the food you're eating - sugar, dairy, and gluten were HUGE culprits for me",

But I'm the same way, I really struggle to stay within a calorie goal, and I have a mega sweet tooth. What helps me is finding substitutes that allow me to be satisfied while still eating what I want. For example, if I want a massive plate of pasta, I might do half regular noodles, and half spiralized vegetables. That cuts my calories for that dish in half, but I still get looooooots of food",

				"I would second previous posters to focus more on measurements/ how your clothes fit, instead of the scale. I did Insanity two rounds through and lost a very noticeable amount of fat everywhere- even my face- and the scale didn't budge. If you're increasing muscle mass while burning fat your weight may not change.

I hang out around 165- and 10 pounds of loss for me requires EXTREME dedication to the food scale and monitoring every ounce of food that goes in my pie hole. So- as someone mentioned 28 weeks- at 1 pound a week is about 30 pounds. It's DOABLE- but you have to be dedicated and persnickity about eating out and what you eat. As you get closer to your goal weight you have to get even MORE rigid with your diet. But yes. In theory it IS possible assuming you are leget carrying 30 extra pounds of weight. (not a dig- just saying if you're 5'8 and 130 pounds trying to lose 30 more- then no- it's not healthy or realistic.",
				"They say a realistic goal is 1 lb per week, but it all depends on your current weight and how much you really have to lose. For instance, if you're 100 lbs then 30 lbs would be tough (you get the idea)... but also, look at it in terms of calories. 1 pound is equal to 3,500 calories... so if you can set an exercise routine and couple it with diet to burn/cut 3,500 a week, then you should have a good chance at meeting your goal",

It really helped me understand how many calories I was eating. ETA: I think it is doable, but I agree with what someone else said, to focus on getting in shape vs losing weight. Muscle weighs more than fat so you can appear skinnier even if you weight more. When I started working out I weighed about 130 but was in terrible shape.

That's not for everyone, but it worked fine for me if I chose the right foods. Now I've switched to a maintenance calorie limit because I bought my dress and it fit off the rack and I don't want to spend a bunch on alterations. For now I've switched to strength and flexibility work to increase my fitness.

With most foods, you can just scan the barcode or look them up, they have a huge database that makes recording what you eat way easier. I used it and was able to lose weight with minimal to no exercise. ETA: Just saw that there was a second page and you said you couldn't stick with MFP. Sorry! I say use it to at least find out what your daily calorie intake should be and at least try to keep a mental tab on it. I used to use it all the time, but now that I have a good idea of how much I can eat, I usually just use it to look up any foods I'm unsure about",

				"It honestly depends on you, but you have enough time to reach your goal. Good luck!",
				"Hi Honeybee! Your goal is very realistic but since muscle is denser than fat (see picture attached) so if you focus on inches and progress pictures it can be a much better measurement of success. I like to use the app myfitnessplan, always consult with a physician first but here's my little secret (well not a secret lol-but it works like a charm!) Step # 1. Take your bodyweight in lbs. Step # 2. Multiply that number in between a number between 17-21. This number is the amount of calories that your body needs to maintain that shape right now. ***Here's the catch...if your not currently at that number then you have to be at that number, or as close as realistically possibly before you go any further. (And this is why sometimes people who start eating more start losing weight, we have to get things back on track). Step # 3. (Well it's actually 2/3 , this and the top step match together). Set your macros and your calorie count in myfitness pal. I usually do 30 carbs, 40 protein, and 30 fat to start and then adjust the macros later. Step #4. Once the macros and calories are being hit at a consistent basis then I cut my calories - usually by 15-20%. That's a part of a problem that it is Imperative to already be high enough otherwise when you cut you will end up cutting to too little calories and mess up your system. I LOVE exercising, I really do. But it's actually not the exercising part that will get you there. The exercise is just asking the 'icing to the cake\"-sculpting your muscles and \"tightening up your body\". The money is in tracking what you eat-that's how you get ahead any time. I hope this helps!!!",
				"When I did P90X, we would do all of our meal prep on Sundays, and have everything weighed out and in tupperware in the right portion sizes. Snacks too (1 TBSPN almonds, etc). As many have said, you have to be SUPER diligent. I'm struggling with this right now myself...I need to log my food and my water intake, and I just get sidetracked. Another app alternative is Sparkpeople. They have an app and a website (sparkpeople.com), that has community, challenges, food and fitness trackers, etc. They also have this cool tool that helps you calculate nutritional value for your own homecooked meals that may not be on their site. Here's a link for that part: https://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-calculator.asp Find exercises that you enjoy. A friend of mine has recently started kickboxing classes, and she goes 3-5 times a week because she loves it so much. Good luck!!",

I dont loose any weight because of my eating habits but im so close to my 6 month mark and im going to make sure i make the change and eat clean to hopefully see my results! Eating clean is KEY! Also, im not super concerned about the number on the scale, more concerned about the inches i loose! So that is another way to track your progress.",

Just lower your sugar intake, drink loads of water, cut breads out and start walking more. I'd advise starting to run a few times a week, its a great exercise to get hooked on. Satin dress, non poufy and I still got super hot beneath it.",
				"Waist trainers are SO unhealthy. Please, do not do this. There are so many great ways to burn fat and lose inches, but please do not take a dangerous route just for your wedding. It's not worth it.",
				"\"If you want to lose weight, you have to eat less that your body needs. Calculate your tdee and eat less than that amount.\" This is not true. The vast majority of individuals who are overweight or obese consume way more calories than their body actually needs. In order to lose weight, you cut back on calories, yes, but you do not need to go below what your body requires and doing so can be dangerous.",
				"If you were to wear a waist trainer you could just end up with back bulge where the skin rolls over the top of it, it has to go somewhere",
				"I wouldn't wear one under your dress.",
				"Instead of a waist trainer, you can wear a waist cincher under your dress if you really need one (although I agree with everyone else, eat healthy and workout). It just shapes your midsection with elastic breathable fabric, just temporarily while you wear, just like shape wear. It won't give you that extreme unnatural looking hourglass shape the a waist trainer will. But that's the extent I'd go for your wedding day. Corsets/waist trainers do all sorts of dangerous things, like limit your lung capacity. You don't need that on one of the happiest days of your life.",
				"Waist training, when done properly, is not dangerous or life threatening, or anything people are saying here. Moving your organs around is not dangerous--it happens naturally during pregnancy.When waist training, it should never cause pain. If there is pain, you are doing it wrong. Please do research before going into waist training--I would highly highly reccommend Lucy's Corsetry on youtube.Waist training in and of itself takes a long time to show noticeable results (6mos to 1yr), and it does NOT cause you to lose weight. If youd like to lose weight, you can't beat the classic diet-and-exercise route. To that end, I cannot recommend seeing a nutritionist enough. Exercise is good and all, but weight loss comes from what food you eat. (according to research I was personally a part of; I honestly didn't believe it at first either)",
				"Waist trainers tend to become uncomfortable if left on for long periods of time. I vote skip it. It would be challenging to try and take it off due to discomfort once you're in your dress, especially if you are at your reception and have to sneak away.",
				"Hi Gorgeous! I'm not sure how far away your wedding is but getting married is about celebrating you and your marriage <3, life is meant to be sexy- not someone else pinterest definition of perfect. I've never had a waist trainer before but I would imagine it being uncomfortable and on your wedding you deserve to have fun celebrating with your family and friends and relaxing :-). Weight loss does take time but if you start small with getting a container for your proteins and a separate smaller ones for your complex carbs (veggies etc.) Measure out your portion sizes and eat multiple times throughout the day. This way you are not hungry, but you are still working out towards your goal :-). And if you have time to try out your magic bullet then that's the icing on the cake but this way your enjoying prepping for your wedding without being hungry, slave to your diet, or having to worry about a waist trainer under your wedding dress",
				"I love my waist trainer!!!! I'm about to buy a new one though but it works!!! If you're on dancing and really moving your body then I wouldn't wear it the day of unless u are really use to it",
				"Heck no! I think those things are pretty heavy and uncomfortable. If you want something to suck you in more, get a corset.",
				"Not under the dress. I wear one at night and wake up with my body still contoured to the shape. It's unhealthy, organs blah blah.... pregnant women's organs are moved and squished for months. A waist trainer won't kill you if you use it here and there. Extreme diet and extreme exercise always work for me. Call it what you will",
				"^^ so much nope nope nope nope. Extreme diet and extreme exercise are super unhealthy. As is a waist trainer.",
				"Works for me and I'm still alive and healthy lmao. Extreme diet as in only fruits veggies and protein. Extreme exercise as in 1 2 hours of vigorous cardio a day.... how is that unhealthy??",

				"Eat less, move more.",
				"I use weight watchers just to hold myself accountable for everything I eat. It's so easy to say \"oh it's just one splurge!\" And then do that multiple times a day/week. It adds up quickly and logging what I eat is helping me realize how many sweets and carbs I \"splurge\" on.",
				"Do WeightWatchers! It works miracles.",
				"If you can swing the cost, I will tell you the best thing I have done is hire a personal trainer. I have horrible anxiety that would keep me from going to the gym myself, but the cost of cancelling an appointment, plus having someone there who knows what they are doing encouraged me to show up. I work out with the trainer twice a week and run/walk near my house or work 2 or 3 other times a week. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but if I am craving something sweet I will make protein cakes with a meal replacement shake. If I'm going to eat bad food, it's going to be pizza or cheese fries. I limit myself to one cheat meal a week, with mostly protein and veggies for other meals. If you are a drinker, try to switch to vodka waters. Surround yourself with a good support system and those with similar goals. Don't get discouraged if you have a bad day. And remember it's 80 percent diet and 20 percent exercise. Having a good diet really goes a long way. If time is a constraint, try to meal prep. I go to Sam's club and cook a bunch of easy meals Sunday evenings.",

				"Long answer? First off- congratulations for taking steps in the right direction to improve your life and your health. You have already pretty much conquered the first steps- Eat less- move more- and create positive CONSISTENT habits. You don't have to be a rock star at this game- you just really need to be patient and STUBBORN. I.E. keep doing the things. No matter how mundane no matter how difficult you think the process is- and now matter how you FEEL about it- just keep doing the things. Make them auto pilot. You'll have bad days- we all do. #drinkingmorewinethanIshouldrightnow So- even \"the best\" of us who seem to \"have it all together\" we have our bad days- I promise you- most people don't share them- but we have them. So don't think those fabulous super fit people in the gym have it all together all the time. They don't. Trust. Now. On to the next. Diet. You absolutely 100% do not need to work out to lose weight. #scoutshonor Does it help? you're damn right. But you do not NEED it. So- first things first- make sure you're keeping yourself in a calorie deficit. If you for some reason go OVER your goal- remember IT'S A DEFICIT- So- at worse- you won't gain weight- you'll just stay right where you are if you continue to eat at the calories you consumed that day. So- DON\"T PANIC. Averages are everything- so if 6 out of 7 days you're in a deficit- WIN!!! You're average is going to be in the \"deficit\" side. You just have to make more good choices than bad ones. That's easy enough right!!!- you got this. TWO- read this article- it's wonderful- and it's written by nation wide trainer who lives also on MFP- extremely well respected- and knows his shit. for real. http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/discussion/1080242/a-guide-to-get-you-started-on-your-path-to-sexypants/p1 again- averages and consistency are key. Being said- the closer you get to goal weight- the harder it is- and the more disciplined you have to be- most people stop 5-10 pounds shy of their weight because you have WAY less wiggle room for mistakes. THREE So- a general fitness/wellness program will incorporate both cardiovascular work AND strength training. You want to do both. \"But Jo- you said you don't NEED to work out.??!?!\" You're absolutely right grasshopper- but it sure will help!!! In fact it will do 3 things: 1.) Ensure you're in a calorie deficit. 2.) Ensure the body you wind up with is something closer to your minds eye than just \"a smaller version of who you are today. 3.) Optimize FAT loss- and minimize MUSCLE loss. weight = anything- fat, muscle- bone density- you're left arm- anything. what you want specifically is FAT loss- so you should be doing some sort of resistance training to optimize fat loss. This also helps change your body composition so you don't look like just you know- a smaller you. It also makes your day to day life more convenient and easier. Being stronger makes life easier. So- win all the way around. So- walking- swimming- classes- spin- zumba- whatever tickles your funny bone for cardio- kickboxing- doing a 5K- whatever. ANYTHING is good- just do it. Strength- no purre barre is not strength training. Neither is body pump. yes it's good for you. No it's not really strength training. Anything that can be done in a class or on a DVD isn't strength training- outside of BeastBody by beach body- very little you do is going to be strength oriented- more \"cardio/fat/burning/resistance/HIIT training. Please understand- none of this is bad- but it's not the same as actual strength training. If you have a gym- I would recommend- Starting strength, strong lifts, new rules of lifting, and strong curves. Skip any program that has you doing it \"bi's/tris and back/chest\" you don't need that. If you do not have a gym- I would recommend- Body by you, You are your own Gym- convict conditioning and nerd fitness. what you're looking for is PROGRESSIVE loading- not those ridiculous shape magazine workouts with no sense or reason. Also- bonus fact Muscle does not \"weigh more than fat\" it's more DENSE than fat. A pound of muscle weighs as much as a pound of fat.I.E. you can fit more of it into a smaller space- fat takes up more space.which is why you get things like STACI!!! who looks so much tinier even though she may weigh more. https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2011/07/21/meet-staci-your-new-powerlifting-super-hero/being said.Please do not be afraid of lifting. I've been trying to get \"huge\" for years.actively TRYING to get bigger- I am admittedly bigger than some people would prefer to see themselves- but even after over a decade of lifting- and focused diet the last 5 years- people are just now starting to say \"oh you look like you work out\" when I'm in regular clothes and not flexing. And to me- I'm not big enough- (GROW SHOULDERS GROW_ I COMMAND YOU TO GROW!!!)it's fucking hard as shit to get big- so please don't say \"I build muscle and get big to quick\". #notbuyingit.Lift the weights- watch what you eat. And be stubborn as shit. The main ingredient missing from most peoples stories is \"persistence\" gotta have faith in the long game. So- YES- you can do this. You GOT this. I have faith in you. #teamtinypotato",

				"Here's a long list of my advice based on person experience:- Apps definitely help keep you aware of what you're eating.- Be careful of under eating though. If your body goes into starvation mode, it'll lower your metabolism and make it harder to lose weight. - I'm not sure if it's doable for you with your schedule, but I found that lifting heavy weights helped a lot, even more than cardio. (but if you end up doing this w/o cardio you'll be less able go by just pounds because of muscle gain. - lastly, I did a month of Tiny Tea. I'm always iffy about sharing this because it doesn't work as a cure-all, the way it's advertised. However, it did cause me to lose water weight while I was drinking it (the main thing I does is reduce bloating), it helped me stay in check with when & what I was eating, and it made me drink a lot more water, which decreased my appetite/cravings.",
				"If there's a way you can fit fitness classes into your schedule I think that's a great way to stay motivated and push yourself harder than you would alone. Spin classes, bootcamp classes, kickboxing etc are all great workouts and really fun! Having a set schedule for the classes can make it easier to incorporate into your life too, knowing on x day at x time I'll spend an hour at this class etc.",
				"Sign up for MyFitnessPal IMMEDIATELY. It's free. Track everything you put into your mouth. Buy a food scale (mine was $12 on Amazon). Make it a priority once a week to meal prep. I do this on Sunday and have all my lunches for the week. Many say they \"don't have time\" but we all have time, it's just what you prioritize and what you don't.",

Right now the meds are helping a bit but only for so long.. I've tried excederin, Tylenol, motrin, Benadryl, and any other OTC drug you can think of.. I have prescription for Flexiril (muscle relaxer ) , tramadol, and sumatriptan. PCP told me to take tramadol and sumatriptan together. I also throw in zofran because migraines make me nauseous.

It's so much more than \"just a headache.\" Check your blood pressure, just to make sure that's okay. I know sometimes high blood pressure can cause them. Also, try putting a cold towel or ice pack on the back of your neck. I read that the combo of a cold towel around your neck and your feet in warm water somehow works to relieve the migraine. Spicy foods help as well! I've read that feverfew tea works wonders. Here's what I found online: \"Some evidence indicates feverfew tea works best as a preventative measure and will not stop a migraine once it\u2019s started, so if you experience migraines it might be worthwhile to make feverfew a part of your daily routine. It can be purchased at health food stores in capsule form, or you can purchase the dried leaves to steep in a tea. The tea will have a bitter flavor and may irritate your mouth, so proceed with caution. About 50-100 milligrams (mg) per day should do, or one to two cups of tea per day. Please note that it could take a few weeks to start working, and that it should be taken with food.\" Try to drink lots of water and get a good nights sleep every night too and try not to let yourself get hungry, always have snacks that are low in salt on hand. I've heard chocolate, citrus, and cheese can all trigger a migraine or make it worse.",

				"Oh ladies, you have no idea when it comes to my eyes lol.. I have horrible vision.. I wore contacts (glasses part time) for the longest time and switched to glasses full time in April. I work medical records too! I am on the pill. :/ FH and I plan on me going off it right around our wedding, but maybe earlier now if that can cause the headaches .. Eek. I'm not sure I can handle Botox but if it comes to that, I'll do whatever I can!!! I'll be looking into peppermint oil!!!(eh, what do you do with it? Sorry if that's a stupid question, I honestly don't know)",

				"I had almost constant headaches from dehydration and gluten. Keep in mind that a lot of foods/part of foods can stay with you for weeks. Gluten can stay in your system for roughly four weeks. Some other proteins linger much longer. I'm not sure how long you ate \"clean\" but I recommend writing everything you eat down, and then also writing down when you get your headaches and what type of head it is (dull, sharp, pressure). After a few weeks, or maybe even months, you may be able to make some connections. I notice a huge difference when I don't watch what I eat and drink. If I drink less than 60 ounces of water a day, headache. Gluten or too much sugar, headache. I also have horrible seasonal allergies that lead to sinus headaches too, which is why it's important to keep a record of the type of headache. ETA: I was on a daily dose a pain management med to manage my headaches but began looking for alternatives when my liver staying healthy became a concern at 17 years old.",
				"Lela, no amount of oil or tea is going to help someone with chronic migraines. Trust me, I have tried EVERYTHING! Considering your history I'm sure insurance will cover a good chunk of Botox treatments for you. I'm trying to start treatment but I moved and haven't found a new neurologist. My last neurologist put the paperwork through for me but I moved before I could start. Good luck to you!!!",
				"Identifying triggers is an important piece. Diet, hydration and sleep schedule are all potentially important factors. I used to get a few migraines per week but chiropractic care helped me a ton.",
				"I have severe migraines that will make me so sick that even a sliver of light makes me throw up. That being said I take flexerol (not sure of the spelling) and it usually works. Sometimes I have to double or triple my dose but it works. Be careful with Zofran. My doctor told me that a recent study has shown that women who were trying to get pregnant became unable to do so and pregnant women taking Zofran had babies born with disabilities due to the medication. I found this out after taking Zofran religiously for another medical issue.",
				"If you have more than 14 migraine days a month you might qualify for Botox. I suffered from migraines 20 days a month before my Botox injections. I am also on an ssri daily as a preventative. I use flexeril at night and relpax when one hits. I also use m-grain, a young living brand essential oil. Although it doesn't totally get rid of them, it makes them manageable til my prescriptions kick in. If you can identify triggers, that would of course would be the best thing. My neurologists explained to me that chronic migraine sufferers don't necessarily have to have triggers like other people do though- that our body has gotten in the routine of having migraines & so a previous migraine is our trigger for a new one (not the same as rebound headaches caused by the medicine) I'd suggest finding a neurologist that specializes in migraines/headaches. That's what I've done & it's worked wonders. ETA- do not let the injections scare you if Botox is an option for you. It's much less painful than migraines. I get 200 cc injected dvery three months and barely blink an eye to them now.",
				"I also get migraines(have since I was 8) and I recommend keeping a food journal and eliminating things(dairy, gluten, etc) one at a time to see if it you can pinpoint anything causing them. Diet can be a huge trigger for migraines. It's kind of a pain but if you are anything like me you get to the point you are desperate enough to try anything! I've also put peppermint oil on my temples. It lessens the pain somewhat for me, but it doesn't make them go away totally. It does seem to help with my nausea though.Also, have you ever taken a preventative? I was on topamax for about a year and the side effects were terrible but ultimately worth it because the frequency and intensity both improved quite a bit.",
				"Ugh I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I get migraines (thankfully infrequently...they started in my teen years) but when I do get them they're downright scary. Every time I've had one in recent years I've been dehydrated and either in the bright sun or just very muggy weather. I've gotten them in the middle working out or at the end of a day when I haven't had enough water.Definitely check with your doctor that you're on a BCP that isn't aggravating this for you. I take Zovia and haven't had any issues, but I know certain types are not recommended for migraine sufferers. I also take b vitamins and magnesium daily-both are known to help reduce migraines, but their levels get depleted by birth control pills, so I take supplements.",
				"I frequently get severe tension headaches that cycle with really intense neck pain. While they are not migraines, I feel your pain so to speak. You and I have similar fears for our wedding day. I've been tracking mine for several months and they are usually the week before my period. I'm on sumatripan for the headaches and cyclobenzaprine for the muscle relaxer. I've found seeing a chiropractor has been really helpful at shortening my headache cycles. Previously was having probably 3 to 4 days a week with muscle tension and now I'm down to 1 or 2 around my cycle. I'm not sure if you have tried that or not but may be worth looking into. Botox as others have suggested has had good results from what I've read. I hope you find the relief you are looking for!",
				"I used to get them about three times a week. Caffeine is my huge trigger. I stay away from it but heat and stress are also triggers and hard to avoid. My doc put me on Topamax which is a maintenance Med not a treatment for an actual migraine. I take it every night. I have had two migraines since February. Life changing! And the only side affect is it makes me sleepy so I take it night before bed.Eta words",
				"The peppermint oil goes on your temples. Some people are sensitive to the straight oils so dab a carrier oil such as coconut oil on the spot first than a couple dabs on peppermint. I've also gotten a humidifier that can use essential oils and use it on particularly bad days too",
				"I get chronic migraines all the time. I have tried everything you have and I have yet to get any relief. I want to try the piercing as well but a lot people said it didn't work. I don't want to try Botox for the fear of a mess up, and the pills work for a small amount of time. FH doesn't believe that I have migraines so I have no idea what to do.",
				"Vicks vapor rub helps me so much. I rub it on my temples, put on a sleeping mask and take a nap. I wake up and feel 10x better",
				"I also have really bad migraines and I know a bunch of people who have gotten a daith piercing and it has really worked for them! I'm definitely going to get one soon, I recommend doing some research and seeing if it's right for you",
				"I used to take Imitrex (sumatriptan). I now instead take the dissolvable Maxalt - works way better for me. I take a maxalt and a few ibuprofen the second I feel one coming on. If pain hits, I take some narcotics. Sometimes throw in a zofran, too. If it's been a few hours since having any caffeine, I'll add in a cup of coffee.",
				"I used to get migraines and had several doctor prescribed medications as well as over the counter and nothing worked. Then I read the weirdest thing.... Hard boiled eggs. I tried and it is truly the only thing that alleviates or at the very least, makes it tolerable! Hope it helps :/",
				"How's your diet? My migraines are gone now that I don't eat gluten.",
				"If you do decide to go GF or gluten free you will most likely have to cook/make from scratch everything. Gluten hides and has strange names. Labeling is getting better but still imperfect. Some people are so sensitive that even being processed in the same facility as wheat will trigger their symptoms.",
				"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. My mom has chronic migraines as well. She gets all the same treatments and no solutions yet. She wants to try acupuncture to see if it helps.",
				"I get them smells and Chemical senativity, so cleaners, perfumes, shampoos anything with added smells. Also mold and mildew, and rooms without fresh air, a hot stuffy car can ruin my day. The worst smells for people like us are flower smells, the best safer smells are foods smells like vanilla, strawberry, coffee etc. It might be a mix of this, food senativity, medication and stress.. I hope all goes well on your day.. good luck figuring it out.",
				"Topiramate and Topamax are the same thing. Topiramate is the generic. I also want to say I went gluten free at the beginning of the year, so that very well could be contributing to the decrease in migraines along with the use of Topamax.",
				"Have you ever been to a chiropractor? Getting realigned can open the pathways in the nervous system and help alleviate headaches.",
				"Chiropractors are useless if you arent getting massage/nmt as well. your crappy muscles just pull your bones back into the same dumb spot they were in.",
				"The only thing that works for me is straight up peppermint oil. I put a single drop on the roof of my mouth and hold for 10 seconds, and another drop I rub on my temples. I was skeptical at first, but oh my marbles, it is the best thing and relieves the pain in 2 minutes.",
				"Go see a neurologist who specialises in migraine. It's the best thing I ever did, I was able to have a properly tailored treatment for the types of migraine that I have. I'm not going to mention my treatment because what I do won't work for everyone because I have a very specific type of migraine. I do recommend finding treatments that work for you through a doctor.",
				"Thanks for all the advice I'm going save a lot of it. I actually screen shot a lot and sent it to FH (he's at drill and super bored lol) I'm blessed with a FH that is super compassionate. Those that never experienced it don't quite understand the pain. My pcp did adjust my neck, but as far as a chiropractor, my ortho specialist pretty much said he would no longer see if I went to one :/ I have rods/screws in my spine so if they some how tweak any of the hardware, he won't fix it. I plan to try some these suggestions before getting myself another doctor bill Lynsey, thanks so much, I'm going to go look for that app!!!",

				"My sister and I both have migraines, although hers are definitely much worse. She got the piercing because she figured she had nothing to lose by trying. It may be a total coincidence, but she has only had one or two since she got the piercing a few months ago.",
				"Botox injections have given me my life back! Totally worth those 40 injections - some hurt and some don't, and it's over in about 10 minutes...for 3 months of feeling like a (relatively) normal person...",
				"I used to get them a lot from birth control...as soon as I stopped taking the BC, I rarely got them anymore. I agree with PP: figure out what the cause is first.",
				"@LelaD do you do to the same doctor to get all of these prescriptions together? Generally, Tramadol, Zofran, and Imitrex and not taken together due to the additive risk of serotonin syndrome. However, your doctor may feel the benefit outweighs the risk. Have you considered starting a daily medication to try and avoid migraines? There are a lot of options you can discuss with your doctor to try and prevent them before they even happen. Good luck, that must be so hard for you",
				"@Lela - I do really recommend a doctor that specialises in migraine. You need a treatment programme that works for you. The problem with asking on a forum such as this is that you are going to get a hundred different answers because a hundred different things work for a hundred different people. Take for instance me: I cannot take triptans (imitrix and the like, they a) do not work and b) raise my heart rate significantly) Botox didn't touch my migraine pain, and most of the pain medications don't work for me. I don't get hormonal migraines, mine are caused by barometric pressure. Medication affects me in a specific way so I'm on a below therapeutic level of an anti-seizure medication and a couple of other treatments which I won't mention because it's tightly monitored by my doctor and not recommended for everyone. You need to see a proper doctor.",
				"I was getting at least 15 migraines per month. For about 8 years now. Most of them were 3 days long. I've been on a preventative drug that I take every day which does not do anything at all. The only thing that helped? Migraine calendar. I had been seeing a neurologist but decided to try a migraine specialist. Their first homework assignment was a migraine calendar. Best decision I ever made. It allowed me to figure out what was triggering my migraines. Another helper? Although caffeine does help migraines, it can also hurt migraines. I had been drinking at least 1 cup of coffee every day for the last 12 years. My migraine specialist suggested giving up caffeine. I slowly stopped drinking caffeine. Since then? My migraines have gone from 15 per month to 2-3 per month. If you are addicted to coffee, I'd suggest stop drinking it and see if you notice a difference. I know a few people it made a huge difference for. I also have the triptans but they make my face, neck and shoulders completely numb for a few hours so it freaks me out and I don't take them.",
				"I found sumatriptan to be garbage. I could have taken a Pez for the same relief. Have you seen a neuro? That's what it finally came to for me. Now I take Propranolol everyday to help prevent them and rizatriptan (Maxalt) if I get one. I've never been able to find a cause for mine. So sometimes the best you can do is try to prevent them and find a treatment that actually works for you. This regimen has worked for about a year for me. But just recently I've started having headaches again...So if it becomes a problem, it's back to the neuro for Botox shots. Good luck.",
				"I was finally referred to a neurologist. So hopefully they will have a better solution for me! I will be seeing them on the 27th of this month! Thanks for all the advice!",
				"My migraines are triggered by my period and alcohol (lame...) I recently stopped the pill and I'm hoping that will lessen the pain of the migraine. It's too soon to tell, though. I've thought about the piercing, but I also heard, if done wrong, it can paralyze one side of your face...? I haven't done enough research into it to see if there's any validity to that claim, though. My doctor advised that I keep a journal to find out my triggers. That's helped!ETA: prior to my diagnosis, I was a OOT pill-popper. I took anything and everything I could think of to try to lessen the pain. I was then prescribed Treximet. Huge relief!",
				"Are you on birth control? If so, try stopping it for a month. I had migraines for years and took tons of prescriptions that never did anything. My neurologist told me there was no way it was the birth control causing my migraines because it was such a low estrogen pill. After a 5 day migraine and a trip to the ER, I had enough and finally went off the pill against his judgment and bam. That was it. My migraines stopped immediately. He was baffled. Wish I'd done it sooner. I tell everybody I can that suffers with migraines this because they never think it can be BC that's causing them.",
				"Acupuncture & chiropractor! I have had migraines pretty badly, especially over the last 4 years. Also, I have had seizures (nobody has been able to confirm whether or not they are related to each other, but i believe there is some sort of correlation.) I started doing acupuncture along with chiropractic care a little over a year ago and I am happy to say that the last 4-6 months have been exceptionally great with not having either migraines or seizures. I definitely think it is worth looking into. Goodluck and feel better!",
				"@ Kate, yes I am on the pill.. FH and I have discussed going off of it. I have had so many people tell me the pill has a lot to do with it. so depending on what this neurologist says, I will be considering it. I will also mention it to him about being on the pill.",
				"Someone that my fiance used to work with told him to eat a banana a day. It helped for awhile. Then he started drinking water (at least half bodyweight) we eat healthy meals 90 % of time. He lost a lot of weight & when he gets them now they are much more manageable.",
				"I get a lot of migraines as well. I've learned that drinking more water helps. Try stretching as well to keep muscles loose. I've also noticed that if I skip coffee then I get a caffeine withdrawal headache.",
				"I get hemiplegic migraines and found out mine are triggered both neurologically and hormonally. It's not necessarily birth control that exacerbates the migraines, it's estrogen in the birth control. Now that I'm on a progestin-only pill, I get about four migraines a year.",
				"I always know when my migraines are coming because the pain is always in the same spot. It starts beside my right eye and the pain intensifies to were it hurts to see out of my eye. When I start to feel this pain coming - I try to get ahead of the pain by taking Tylenol Extra Strength and moving to a quite location and a dark room. I also talked with my doctor about how frequently I would get migraines and they put me on a suppressant I take nightly. I believe its call topiramate. I find drinking more water and getting extra sleep helps to get rid of my migraines too. I hope you find something that works for you - I know how much they stink!"

Has anyone here done it? To me it seems similar to carb cycling in a way but a little more simplified. The author also claims it balances out your hormone levels and just rests your body. I have my BS in nutrition so every now and then I get intrigued to see if certain \"diets\" work. So off I go on my diet adventure this week.",
			"comments": [
				"I just bought the book and plan on starting it soon. My doctor actually recommended it to me after I told her I've been having trouble losing a bit of weight that I've gained over the last year. (I've been calorie counting and exercising to no avail.) She said she's seen patients have success with it, especially people with thyroid issues (like me).",
				"That's great to hear doctors are recommending it. The book itself seemed sound, I just wish the cover didn't boast how you can lose weight in a short period of time. That was the one thing that irked me but I kept reading and it all made a lot of sense. I guess the quick weight loss is what draws people in to buy the book.",
				"Yeah I agree that made it seem gimmicky but there's nothing too extreme in the book. I know a lot of people who've lost weight doing the whole 30 which is similarly restrictive for a month (with the no dairy/gluten/alcohol). I don't think I'm going to stop drinking coffee though!",
				"Yea, luckily I don't drink anything caffeinated any ways. It makes me way too anxious and crazy/spazzy. But I definitely understand not giving it up though.",
				"I have tried numerous things and finally get results with body wraps. Lost 6 inches around my belly in less than 2 weeks. To me inch loss is more imporatnt than weight loss , because you gain muscle and weight when you work out.",
				"It seems like a lot of yo-yoing between the different food groups I'm doing the Whole30 and even my boss that sees me every day is commenting on the difference in 30 days. I'm going to keep up with the diet, i feel much better physically and mentally weight loss asside",
				"My mom has lost 20lbs in 2 months after years of no weight loss since going on this diet! She always has plenty of food to eat in a day and *shockingly* doesn't miss cheese. I have eaten some of the recipes and they taste great!",
				"Yep, I really liked it. It's a struggle to make sure you're following it at first, like you have very structured times and food groups, but you get in the swing of it. I started to like the rules, too, because there wasn't like a whole 30 what do I eat now moment, you just... Follow.",
				"Yes I did it! Make sure to plan your meals before the beginning of the week that's what helped me. I also found recipes on Pinterest! Good luck you got thiS! Days with protein are really terrible but it gets better !",
				"Awesome, thank you @chrises and @lauryns. I'm starting day 2 today. Yesterday went pretty well. Meal time made me so full, it was crazy. But I know my body will get used to eating like this. I'm actually eating my breakfast as I type this",

				"My parents both did it and each lost 15-20 pounds. I much prefer the 21 day fix as it focuses more on portion control rather than restricting what you can and cannot eat. If you eat healthier foods and move more, you will lose weight. If you consume less calories than you burn, you will lost weight. There is no magic trick.",
				"That's awesome they lost that much. I know there is no magic trick, I have my degree in nutrition. I'm just curious to hear other people's experience with it. Every now and then I like to check diets out to see if they actually work."

				"I agree you can't spot reduce however you can tone and sculpt your arms. To see the best results lift heavy for less reps. 90% of the max weight you can lift. The thought that you will get bulky is out dated. The women that get huge bulky muscles are often on steroids. Women just don't put on mass like men do.",

			"content": "I am going on day 2 and my hands are very painful. They have a tingling sensation and feeling slightly numb in the joints of my fingertips. I was painting for about 9 hours straight on Saturday and I'm guessing the way my hands were gripping the paint brush and rollers may be the cause of this. Does anyone have any recommendations to relieve the pain? I've been taking Tylenol and massaging my palms but no such luck. Thanks in advance!",
			"comments": [
				"Ibuprofen to ease the internal swelling but I would ask a pharmacist. 1: they can tell you if this is something you should consult a dr on and 2: they can recommend a brace.",
				"Have you seen a doctor?",
				"I work in an office and I experience the tingling/pain when I have days where I have to type a lot. Sometimes I have to force myself to take a break because it's just so uncomfortable to keep typing. Sometimes at home FH will massage my hands and it helps, but other than that I haven't really found anything that works. I don't like taking painkillers unless it's absolutely unbearable. If it gets worse I plan on seeing a doctor.",
				"My dr. gave me a brace to wear when mine acts up. It is definitely awkward for the first couple of days but I get used to it after that. It works wonders and after about a week the flare up goes away and everything is good.",
				"I also have carpal tunnel, and when it flares up, I find that massaging the inside of my wrists, palm side, seems to help the most. Even more so if you can get your fianc\u00e9 to do it for you. Most of the issues you have are from that area becoming inflamed. Acupuncture can help with symptoms as well, if you aren't too scared of needles. There is also this brand of pain relief pads called Salonpas that you peel and stick on your sore muscles... I've also found relief from these. But if this does become a problem, definitely wear your braces the next time you are doing an activity that may strain your wrists. Good luck!",
				"Braces at night, do NOT use them during the day, as that can accelerate and compound symptoms. I've dealt with it for years. It sucks big time. Tylenol will not help, it isn't an NSAID. Take ibuprofen and, if your stomach can tolerate it, Aleve. You need to keep up on the dosing though, because you're using them primarily for inflammation rather pain relief. Ice, not heat, can help. Stretch your hands, bend your thumbs toward your wrists. The only way to help is time.",
				"I wear a brace at night when mine flares up, does the trick.",
				"Thank you all! I haven't seen a primary physician in about 3 years so I'm in the process of getting one as I just got insurance. I'm going to get a brace today to see if that helps. I thought I was being a wuss about painting but it's day 2 and once the Tylenol wears off its unbearable to sleep to the point I want to cry. I will have to try aleve.",
				"Something like biofreeze can help. Always helps my knee aches.",
				"Do things that will reduce inflammation (cold compress, nsaids, rest, etc) in the short term. See a doc ASAP.",
				"You can get night braces at most drug stores and they really helped me. I ended up getting the surgery on both hands 2 years ago because the neuropathy started keeping me awake at night I still have it but not as intense. The night braces do help a lot though !",
				"Something similar happened to me. I went to a bone doctor and my wrists were strained (I work a desk job and type all day). He suggested that I wear braces (you can get them from a drugstore) on my wrists for a few weeks. I would suggest wearing them at night or during the day for a few days. However, it doesn't hurt to get it checked out.",
				"Yes to everything mna & HouseOfAllen said.",
				"Stretch your wrist/ fingers by extending your wrist and pulling your fingers back. This probably makes no sense but if you can understand that, it's from a therapy standpoint lol",
				"Agree with above- brace, ice, NSAIDS. See a doctor. Carpal Tunnel, especially bilateral is associated with hypothyroidism so important to get that checked.",
				"Chiro or ortho dr",
				"I have carpal tunnel that comes and goes. When I feel it coming on I wear my brace for a while and it usually goes away.",
				"I suffer from carpal tunnel I would recommend taking ibuprofen and wearing a wrist brace at night. I also do finger stretches, thumb to index, middle, ring and pinky and repeat when my hand gets tingly and wrist stretches like @JPL recommends. Massage daily, and ice. If it doesn't get better check with your doctor.",
				"I got some acute tendonitis and my coach recommended aspercreme. You might want to look into if that would help you. Also, my friend has arthritis and she eats yellow raisins soaked in rum and swears it helps, maybe thats similar?",
				"Thank you all for this helpful advice! I picked up aleve and continue icing and massaging. I plan on setting up an appointment with a primary physician soon. Thank you again!",
				"Get a brace. My mom wears hers to sleep every night and it helps a lot.",
				"(I didn't read previous comments so someone may have suggested this) but something that helps the swelling go down-advil or something like that and alternating putting your hands in warm and cool water can temporarily help. And see a doc if you haven't already. Set up two bowls one with warm water (not lukewarm but not hot) and the other with room temperature water and you soak your hand in one for a few seconds, then put it in the other bowl I think for about 5 mins. I know that sounds strange but the alternating the water and the temperatures helps the swelling to go down. I had CTS really bad in my right hand (it got so bad that my fingers were stuck in claw like shape-it was not fun at all) and that water trick was extremely helpful. I also had to start wrapping my hand with an ace wrap to give it more support when typing and writing. Hope you feel better."

My life at the moment is so busy with work, coaching, wedding stuff, the kids's sports and clubs, and FH working out-of-town, that my entire routine has been off for months and I need to find my way back. Usually, I go a very regimented, restrictive route when this happens to get me back on track and under control until I can re-establish better habits. Many people at my work swear that the Advocare program helped with exactly that...real food, on a more limited list, with proper supplements, until one can work their way back to a better normal.

				"I did it a few years ago, and quite successfully I might add. But I'm 99% certain it was because I ate really well and exercised consistently through the full 24 days, not because of the piles of horse pills they give you. The basic components are: eat well, get fiber, take your vitamins, drink water. I don't think you need to pay for the challenge to do this, just research suggested meals and follow it for 24 days.Eta: I lost 7 pounds in the 24 days, and I was quite thin at the time so 7 pounds was somewhat substantial. but again- I was dedicated to my health. I don't think the challenge items did anything for me.",
				"I tried it. I haaaaated how many pills I had to take. The fiber drink was horrific. I had to stand over the sink because I gagged so much. I like Spark and still use it. It helps with not wanting coffee or cokes. I lost a little but not enough to make me want to continue.",
				"I did it. I honestly think it is way overpriced for something you can do yourself with diet and exercise. I don't think the pills help a whole lot. I lost like seven pounds. But I think it was only because I was eating really healthy. No cheat days. And exercising everyday. The breakfast shakes were totally awful.",
				"I used to be a distributor of Advocare and I would recommend a ten day cleanse. It teaches you the right eating habits, but it cleans out your system (not in an uncomfortable way though) and jump starts weight lose!",
				"And if you do it, mix the fiber drink with Orange juice instead of water. SO much better!",
				"Thanks, Ladies. Your feedback is fairly similar to what my co-workers have told me. At this point, not having to think too much about what to eat and when is exactly what I need. Having a set, limited list to choose from makes it kind of brain dead for me. Once things simmer down and I have the time to prepare better for lunches and dinners, it won't be hard at all to get back on track.",
				"You can google everything advocare teaches you without paying for the product. Even the 10 day cleanse isn't worth it in my opinion.",

The first time I did the full 24-day challenge, I lost 16 pounds during the cleanse phase (that can't be healthy!), but gained 10 back during the refuel phase and I was religious about sticking to the program and eating correctly. The biggest thing with Advocare is that it is supposed to be a lifestyle change, so if you are not willing to eat a crap ton of veggies every day, no sweets, and rarely indulge, then it may work great for you. But doing a 24-day challenge then going back to fast food, you will see the weight come back. I do however totally recommend their fiber drink. It is better than Benefiber",
				"I have done 3 24-day challenges now. Each time I lose at least 10lbs. I did it once and fell off the wagon because I went out of town for 2 weeks and ate out 3x a day for 2 wks straight. But other than that, the weight has stayed off. I am down 30lbs and have more energy and motivation than I ever have! I love AdvoCare!",
				"I'm on day 20 of the plan right now. I lost 6 lbs during the cleanse phase, but due to family trips, I back slid a bit. I am down about 6 pounds still (after gaining back my initial loss, thanks to the road trips and celebratory drinks last weekend). I have had to set a timer on my phone reminding me to eat and take the supplements. THAT is a pain. Other than that, I find it is pretty easy. I'm still reserving judgement."

In other words I don't believe I can just start a new pack instead of taking his the sugar pills. There is some sort of other method that must be done with these pills. I am going to call my doctor tomorrow and get her advice- but I am wondering who else has skipped or delayed their period using Trinessa. How'd you do it? Did it all work out ok?! Did it ruin your life?! Lol. There's no way I can be on my period during my WEDDING and honeymoon. I bloat horribly and feel awful. Advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you!",

I haven't done that in a long time though.",

So I would see if you are a ecto, meso, or endomorph. This explains why some lose weight easy, struggle to lose weight, or can barely hold any weight on them. They will give you a good work out routine for you to do when trying to figure out how much cardio and strength you will need to do. Signed up for the Lose It app for one month to see how many calories I eat. For my body type, I did cardio 3 times a day for 30 minutes and strength 2 times a day for 20 minutes. I used the Sworkit app for free and used no equipment.You need both to help you lose weight really good. Don't worry you won't bulk up cause that's the misconception with strength training. Because I was a stay at home mom on a budget, I did not do 100% clean eating just made wiser choices on the foods I would get. Like I started getting wheat bread instead of white, get leaner ground beef or get turkey, instead of mayo on my sandwich used mustard. Started eating breakfast cause I used to not eat it at all. Increased fruits and veggies. I know some people say you can eliminate carbs or eat a small amount, but there is a certain amount of carbs your body needs so just eat healthier carbs like I would do brown rice and black beans.

I know that a lot of people don't like veg but there's so many different flavors and textures and ways to prepare it that there's gotta be a vegetable out there for everyone. Question: That whole thing about not eating late, should it really be \"don't eat x many hours before bed\"? Or is it something specific about nighttime?

I lost weight when I was dieting and had to eat dinner at 10pm because I had class all evening. I also used to eat dinner at midnight when I worked at a restaurant from 4-11:30",
				"You are absolutely wasting your time at the gym is you are not fully committed to eating right.",
				"Not eating at night, as pointed out, has nothing to do with weight gain or not. It's perfectly acceptable to eat late at night. I make one of my largest meals of the day after ten pm. It's a matter of \"do you have the calories for it\"? Or did you eat all your allowance already? . Because the issue for most people is they eat all their food during the day, and have nothing left in the calorie budget but eat anyway putting them over their deficit goal. So unless it makes your sick, gives you heart burn or bad dreams you're fine to eat at night allowing that you've left from in you're daily budget for night time snacks. I don't eat till 1 or 2 pm specifically because I have such late nights and I prefer eating when I get home.",
				"Going to the gym \"about 3 or 4 days a week\" and \"kinda\" watching what you're eating is not trying everything. You have to commit to a lifestyle change.",
				"I have also always struggled with weight. Not saying you have, but I have. In the past 2 years I have really struggled. I moved in with my aging mother to help her. Stress has taken it's toll on me. My attention has shifted from me to her. I do try to walk everyday, usually a mile. But, until recently, my health was not good either. (Been battling respiratory issues since Christmas). It's a cycle. If you don't move your body starts to break down. I have read the comments from everyone. And most of them have helped me. My other problems with my health are I am hypoglycemic. I have to eat something every two hours. I have tried to make good choices. When on the run, that's when I struggle. I also have a gluten intolerance and acid bothers me. We don't realize how many bad things are in the foods we consume until we start reading about them. OK, nuff said. Trying to do the right things now. But, it's very slow. Thanks again for info.",
				"I've found always having food with me, whether I was at work or had a day of running errands, really prevented me from buying snacks or fast food on the go. It takes a little extra thought but I lost weight quickly doing this. I would pack a tupperware with some fresh fruit and almonds, carrots and/or celery sticks and either hummus or natural peanut butter, and I often cooked a large batch of beans at the beginning of the week so I could have seasoned beans and couscous. You could also include a hard-boiled egg and/or a small amount of natural cheese. Granted, I'm vegetarian, but if you portion things right it should keep you full. Typically, you need more food when you're eating just veggies vs. meat, so there is a bit of a learning curve if you've never planned veggie meals before. Having a hearty and healthy veggie lunch could help a lot, even if you're eating meat otherwise. As others said, avoiding added sugars, hydrogenated oils (the worst! your body can't properly process them), high fructose corn syrup, white flour, etc. Going for brisk walks - kind of like power walks, get your arms involved and walk at a quicker pace than normal - every day can help a lot too. This is a decent exercise even for those with joint issues and requires no special location or equipment, so I recommend it. I have also found free aerobic workout routines on Youtube if that's something that interests you. Best o' luck!"

When I first stopped I didn't get my period right away. It took about two months. It's been pretty regular tho shorter then a full 28 days. I'm more around 24 days but they only last 3-4 days total which is super nice. The only side affect I feel like since stopping is I get more acne now. I hope this helps!",

Thats right, no period at all, I was freaking out and taking pregnancy tests for 2 months before I went to the doctor, he said it thinned my lining to nothing and I should go off it for a while. Now my normal periods had been light and not terrible on the cramping before they stopped.Now. When I tell you my shark week came in a month with a BLOODY VENGENCE, I am not exaggerating. I was having to change my supers every 2 hours, when I could get out of bed, because my cramps where like nothing I had felt before, I was bedridden for 2 days. Now I'm good, just simple cramping and a very timely everything. But that was the worst I can ever remember it being...Goods luck lol",

				"@ Stephanie Y - that's good to know. And you're right, it's possible I didn't actually ovulate, but I think I did.",
				"I was on BC for a few years because I had awful cramps to the point of throwing up and immobilizing cramps. I got off of it because I had a lot of spotting and my gyno at school was a typical southern Christian and would give me a lecture every time about not having sex until I was married. My periods have always been irregular (come once every 2-6 months) now it comes every month. For two years off of it I had lighter periods with minimal cramps. Recently it has been getting worse, but I think it's because it's always been a bit off.",

I would be due to start a new pack the week after our honeymoon, so I just won't start that one. I'm worried about the stress of last minute planning causing my body to revolt and have me start my period on our wedding day if I were to stop after this pack is done! My gynecologist said that many women that have been taking BC for awhile may end up getting pregnant right away, as the body is all \"Woo! No extra hormones! We aren't being tricked into thinking we are pregnant by the pill now! Ovulate! Ovulate! Ovulate!\" He's had multiple patients get pregnant their first cycle after stopping BC.",

				"Be careful! I stopped taking my pill after 10 years to try out natural family planning bc hormonal mood swings were driving me crazy- was trying to track ovulation and use condoms when we needed to. Took temps every day, paid attention to ovulation signs, etc. Totally got pregnant anyway the first month off the pill. That was 3 years ago lol.",

				"I was on birth control since 2006. I got off it briefly 2x. The first time was because I had a lump in my breast that turned out to be benign and the doctor took me off it for about a month. The second time I came off of it was when I started my raw food diet and started eating organic back in 2012, that last for about 3 months. While off it in 2012, I still got my period. However this last and final time I got off for good. I got off back in November 2015 because I was getting crazy migraines and I thought it was part of the cause. My doctor told me that if I was prone to migraines that bc increases your risk of stroke so I am no longer going to take again. I had my period the end of December into January. It completely skipped the rest of January. Then it came the end of February to March and nothing yet for March. So to say it's a little weird is an understatement lol. was getting nervous when it didn't come like the period tracker said it would, however, I realize that my body is trying to find it's rhythm so I have to give it time and let nature take it's course. It does come, so what I have been doing is eating healthier and I plan to exercise more. I don't want to take any medication or hormones to bring my period on. I plan on researching various herbs that may help and consulting my doctor and go from there. It is normal though to miss your period when coming off of bc especially if it was abnormal when you first started. Do some research and talk to your doctor about it."

Also incorporate exercises that focus on your shoulder (either isolation exercises or all round shoulder exercises; I do isolation exercises that target the back, front, and sides of my shoulders, plus some exercises to work all aspects of the shoulder), to tone. Also, remember that it takes TIME for this to happen. It wont happen over night. I have been working out for a YEAR and still have the little chicken wing.

Also, find some workouts that you ENJOY. Not a runner? Try yoga. Do you enjoy dance? Try zumba,",
				"Good.luck",
				"Gym and yoga. If you build muscle, you burn fat faster, and it kind of 'sucks' everything in for you. If you start going to the gym regularly, throw the scale out and pay attention to how your clothes fit. At my thinnest I weighed 15lbs more than I do now, and was a size smaller (I couldn't fit in a zero because of those damn child bearing hips, but could rock a 2). The yoga just makes you feel good, especially with wedding stress.",
				"Definitely combine exercise with dieting. You can't really be successful (and truly healthy) without both. Either join a gym or buy some dumb bells and try doing some youtube videos at home. Find a type of cardio you like (I hate running, so I bike or do high intensity zumba). I'm a big proponent of the south beach diet, which is essentially complex carbs (so low carb) and healthy fats, with lots of lean protein, veggies, and fruit. Dieting is where you'll get a ton of mixed information, but best advice I can give is to generally eat less and to eat real food, i.e. get rid of processed foods.",
				"Diet is crucial - even my personal trainer admitted it's 80% of weight loss, exercise is only about 20%. (and make sure your exercise includes lifting to build muscle, like Sci Fi Bride says!) What works for me is basic portion control (no seconds, no dessert) and cutting out sugar and flour - so totally ditch sweet tea, soda, pasta, pastries and bread, switch to water or unsweet tea, actual whole grains (bulgur wheat, farro, amaranth, quinoa, brown rice) and sweet potatoes. I ended up cooking a lot more at home from scratch, which ended up cutting my sodium intake too. I'm planning to go back on this to prep for my November wedding myself! That said, I usually go 'off the wagon' after 4-5 months of this, especially around the holidays. Christmas cookies are my kryptonite.",

				"Talk to a trainer and good luck!",
				"Besides all of the above, Make sure you drink a lot of water. If you don't drink enough water you get dehydrated and retain water.",
				"Couch to 5k is a great place to start. And remove refined sugar from your diet. Plenty of water, fruits and veggies.",

Honestly after a while you'll find it's hard to eat the amount your suppose to. But just stick to the gym! Balance out weight lifting and cardio! Also try not to \"diet\" too much. Just portion your food wisely. If you diet and then stop dieting you'll most likely gain all the weight back. So stay positive and just remember why you're doing it! Good luck!",

				"You don't have a lot of time... 5 months realistically. Really fix your diet. Get snacks out of the house. Don't eat out. Remember if it doesn't go bad (canned foods, canned fruit, frozen dinners) it's not GOOD for you. Fresh veggies and fruit and meat and seafood IS good for you. Remember to get fat from good sources -- think avocados or nuts. Incorporate exercise. Aim for 30 minutes of cardio a day with a heart rate over 140. Running, biking, Zumba, cycle, whatever gets you there. And don't stop. So many people stick with it for a couple weeks. It's not a diet--- it's a lifestyle change.",

Anyway, I lose best on a high protein diet from past experience, but I wanted to be healthy about it. I started Paleo diet that is 95% strict and 5% not (think cheese, creamer in my coffee etc.) I have officially as of today lost 10 pounds in 4 weeks! I only have 10 more to go and I plan to shed those before my dress fitting on February 20th. I lost the first 10 pounds without going to the gym and just doing some regular walking. Now I plan to go to the gym to jumpstart the next 10 pounds. Just want to give you the motivation that it is DOABLE. and also the PALEO diet is AMAZING. I can eat and feel full. No starving, no gimmicks. And no killing yourself at the gym.",
				"@livelovelearn, I agree, Paleo is the way to go. I'm doing the 30 Clean program,: no sugar, dairy, soy, grain etc. Prepping the food is a bit of work, but it is so worth it! I can't wait to go for my dress fitting to see how many inches I've lost.",
				"20 pounds in 5 months is VERY doable. Everyone gave great advice. I started this 28 Day Fit Girl Challenge at the beginning of the month and am already down 12 pounds. Like PP said - diet is HUGE. That's the hard part. Check this out if you want. The new group starts Feb 8th. https://www.fitgirls.com/products/28-day-jumpstart",
				"I track all my calories on my Fitbit. I put in my goal weight and when I wanted to be there, and it guides my caloric intake. I also drink TONS of water. I love coffee, so I got a huge starbugs reusable tumbler with a straw, and it goes with me everywhere. You can infuse the water with fruit if that helps.",

				"FIRST: Don't look at a scale. It's only there to discourage you or give you false hope. I lost 40 lbs last year and it surprised me how simple it was to do. (to be fair I gained it back because I became careless so now begins my quest to lose again :] ) Stay active. Sitting around all day at home or at work is a HUGE deterrent to weight loss. If you have a desk job, get up and stretch occassionally or go for a short walk every few hours. If you stay at home during the day, then you can clearly get in more activity, such as going to the gym or doing workouts at home. I never went on a diet, ugh so repulsed by the word, but what I did do was portion control. I ate less ( and by eating less I mean I actually had correct portions and didn't overeat) and had healthier snacks during the day, like almonds or fruit. That's essentially all I did and I was surprised at how well my clothes started to fit. Time to do it again Shame on me.",
				"I suggest both exercise and changing your diet, but if your limited for what you can do, the most important thing would be to change your diet. Obviously limiting your caloric intake to what you realistically need in one day is important, but so are the kinds of foods. Choose nutrient dense options over empty calories and limit alcohol. If you're looking for an exercise program, something involving HIIT would be good. It's more effective on your metabolic rate as compared with steady state cardio. Also ladies, be wary of tracking your steps as a measure of exercise. You need to walk for at least 10 minutes for it to really \"count\" toward something.",
				"Good luck date twin! I've started by changing the food i eat. I know i still eat too much but i'm working on that but at least what i'm eating is a lot healthier, i also go to the gym 3 days a week for 1-2 hours. A lot of cardio will help shed fat.",
				"The best thing you can do is clean up your diet and get moving, but eating right is the most important part! You can't out train a bad diet. I would go on bodybuilder.com and find out how much you should be eating. I track my macronutrients (or macros), which consists of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. I lost twenty lbs in three months by measuring out my food, eating the right amount of macros, and going to the gym. There is a macro calculator on their website! Strength or resistance training (lifting weights) will also help you. If you break down the muscle by lifting weights, then the muscle will develop more over time and continue to burn more fat, so your exercise will do double the work. Cardio doesn't do this, and excessive amounts of cardio will actually make you lose muscle. The best mix is light cardio and more intensive weight training to build that lean muscle up! I'm currently in a program designed by Jessie Hilgenberg, and it shows you how to count your macros and gives you great workout plans. It's only $88 (cheaper than a trainer), and you get access to a private facebook group that is absolutely full of women who do nothing but build each other up and work to reach their goals! I'd highly suggest it! It's definitely helped me stay on track!!",
				"I kick started mine by cutting carbs. This was basically my meals every day. Breakfast: some sort of soup Snack: Apple or string cheese Lunch: Chicken or steak and veggies Dinner: Chicken or steak and veggies Lots of water I walked 2 miles with my kids 3 times a week too. I went from 170 to 150 in 2 months. Then I started craving real food again haha",
				"Definitely throw out the scale. I'm 5'5\" and weigh 160 pounds, but wear a size 4, sometimes 2. Try FitnessBlender.com they have hundreds of free workout videos with lots of variety, plus a blog with tips on weight loss and healthy eating and even some recipes.",
				"Ditto to what most people are saying and also drink lots and lots of water!",
				"I've been tracking all of my calories via the LoseIt! app and am sticking to 1,200 calories/day, plus 2 days/week of cardio/weight lifting at the gym and I climb about 17 flights of stairs/day during the week at work. I've been doing this since mid-October and am down 30 lbs. Diet is key!!",
				"Eat less, move more. Weigh your food to get accurate calorie counts, most people vastly underestimate. I thought I was eating at 1,200 calories, it turned out to be more like 1,600 calories. It really is a game changer. Eat whatever you want, it isn't carbs or gluten or sugar that make you fat, its how many. I've lost 20+ pounds in 1/2 that time without giving up anything.",
				"Use Myfitnesspal to track what you eat and see how much sugar, fat, carbs, and calories you are consuming. No junk food. Start eating healthier foods as well as smaller portions a day. Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner. I'm using shakes as well. GNC lean 25. I make one in the morning with Almond milk. Snack is string cheese. Lunch might be left overs but small portion. or I'll get Joseph's wraps and make chicken or tuna in it. Another snack is the serving of nuts. Then dinner is whatever but small portion. Lots and lots of water. I do have a fitbit, but since I sit at work a lot, I changed my daily step goal to 7,000. Its more reasonable for me. I also use Zumba, which is fun. I do have a Julian Michaels DVD as well that I will start using to mix it up. You can also use the free 30 day challenge apps to tone up- legs, planks, arms. Sticking to it is hard. I just started back again and already have messed up twice. I gained back what I lost. But now I'm so annoyed that I had to re-lose those pounds that could have been even more weight loss total. That helps me stay on track for now.",
				"The gym is my life and I'm so lucky I get to share the same passion with my husband. All I'm gonna say is you have to be committed all the way through. I set a goal for myself and I achieved it bc I didn't quit. Start out with doing a lot of cardio especially if you're trying to burn a lot of fat and then incorporate some weight lifting. Cardio should at least be 30-45 mins a day for people who are looking to lose weight. And start out with that to get yourself commited to going to the gym everyday. When you feel like you're ready, then you can start hitting the weight room. Always, everyday, do abs. No matter what exercise you know, do it. Drink a lot of water. Don't cut out a lot of food all at once bc it's gonna make you go crazy and say whatever and just go back to it. Drink lots of water and use small plates. Snack throughout the day, fruits or yogurt or even granola bars to keep your metabolism going. Most importantly, try to get your FH involved in this with you. Be each other's motivation bc it will help you a lot!! You got this girl!!",
				"Check out JJ Smith, Green Smoothie Cleanse. I've lost over 30lbs in three months following her cleanse and meal guide.",
				"Ideal Protein....look for the support groups on Facebook and also the IP alternatives support group too. I lost 45 lbs in 3-4 months!!!!!",
				"^ bullshit. Ignore people like this.",
				"Weight watchers is helpful! Or, if you can exercise for an hour 4-5 times weekly you should find out what your macros are and follow that. I've lost 15lbs in 4 weeks exercising & following my macros (I also stopped drinking pop in exchange for water...I only drank diet but it makes you retain so much water). You can still eat everything it just has to be portioned (invest in a kitchen scale). The weight comes off quickly in the start...then will slow to 1-2 lbs weekly (depending on how strict you are). Drink water and meal prep so you are never stuck grabbing whatever (in my case it's FHs junk he is so lucky he NEVER gains weight!!) Tip...you'll be hungry for the first couple days and have low energy...if you can get past that it seems to get way easier!!!",
				"Hi! I lost 50lbs last year! Here's how I did it: - Track calories with MyFitness Pal and stick to their calorie goals!! (Make sure to weigh your food to be accurate!) - Do 15 minutes of yoga every morning & 15 minutes before bed (look up Tara Stiles on Youtube) - Drink lemon water first thing in the morning and when you're feeling snacky. It helps to reduce cravings. - Meal plan on Sundays. This will help you avoid running through a fast food restaurant because you don't have a dinner plan and you're tired. - Allow yourself one big cheat meal a week! This actually helps with boosting your metabolism. - If you must use a sweetener in coffee or tea, use stevia! - Eat a salad almost every day! - When you're craving pizza, have a lean cuisine pizza for dinner! - Drink unsweetened (or stevia sweetened) tea throughout the day to keep your stomach full. - Take a walk on your lunch break. Meal Ideas Breakfast: - 1/2 English Muffin, half an avocado, crushed red pepper, and one egg - Fage Nonfat greek yogurt, a touch of honey, and your favorite granola Lunch & Dinner: - Grilled chicken, romaine, red onion, feta cheese, light caesar dressing - Grilled steak, spring mix, dried cranberries & nuts topping, goat cheese, light balsalmic dressing - Lean Cuisine Pizzas!! - Grilled salmon & asparagus - Grilled barbecue chicken (use Stubbs Original) and corn I hope this helps!! Lauren",
				"I've done a lot of different diet and exercise routines in my life but the most effective and long lasting I've ever tried is cutting out sugar. It's hard at first but there's a lot you can still eat (bacon!, cheese!) and the weight falls off. And there's no counting or tracking.",
				"I would definitely watch your nutrition. If working out, multiply your weight times 12 to get enough calories in to lose weight. Also, eat lots of nutritious foods, drink lots of water, limit sugar/alcohol (water, sugar, alcohol and carbs all bloat so you retain water...which you dont want if you are trying to lose weight) What kind of workouts do you like doing? I think since you have 4 months you totally can do this!",
				"Hi Drew! Looking back when you have wanted to lose weight before, what's worked? What didn't work? Don't get burned out by trying to incorporate so many things at once - it's a recipe for disaster. Instead, pick one or two things that you think that you can definitely incorporate into your life starting today. As you find success with those first few things add another. Repeat this process. Before you know it you will be looking and feeling great. Another hint when you start doing the above is to add things in first before you take things away. Sounds counter intuitive, but from a behavioral science point of view it's easier. What to start adding in? Veggies! Try to incorporate as many as you feel comfortable with now and continue increasing the amount till your wedding. You might find some of the other not so great things start to disappear \"magically.\" Also, I'm not sure where you are at in fitness right now, but trying doing a 4 minute tabata workout every other day. (It seems so little and insignificant, but it's crazy how doing just this much gives you so much results) Example: Do each of the following exercises as hard and fast as you can - remember it only lasts 4 minutes so it tricks your mind into thinking that it's almost done and you can push yourself hard the entire time. 20 seconds of squats 10 sec rest 20 seconds of pushups (can be on knees or against a wall depending on your level) 10 sec rest 20 seconds of mountain climbers (can be on the ground or standing - depending on your level) 10 sec rest 20 seconds of jump rope (or mimicking a jump rope action) 10 sec rest Repeat once more Best of luck Drew. Let me know how it goes and if you need anymore suggestions.",
				"My wedding is in July and I'm trying to lose 40lbs, so I feel your struggle. Don't give up! I just want you to know that a) its okay to treat yourself! Eating a piece of cake at your friends b-day won't ruin everything. It's all about moderation! b) Follow your body and its signals. I tried doing high cardio, but I have a standing job so I just didn't have the energy to run on a treadmill after work. Now I do weight-lifting, yoga, and biking (lower cardio). I feel so much better! Also, cut out Starbucks/Timmies/whatever your vice is. I work for Starbucks, so I know how bad everything is! If you love coffee, just stick to plain coffee or get some sugar free syrup in it. I cut 600 calories off of my diet but cutting out Starbucks.",
				"I definitely recommend tracking your food. As tedious as it is, it increases your awareness as far as how much you're actually eating. I don't want to push any crazy diets down your throat, but I am personally doing a low carb variation (the Ketogenic Diet, if you're interested) and I have lost almost 20 pounds since the beginning of the year. Do your research, find something that fits your schedule and stick to it.",
				"I am getting married in May. I had Bells Palsy about a year ago and was prescribed steroids for a few months. They caused me to bloat and gain weight. Not a great wedding dress combo. So, my engagement shoot was my wake up call. I felt uncomfortable in everything I tried on and didn't really feel very pretty. This was really sad to me since I felt so happy about what was happening. I wanted to be in the moment. But, I wasn't. So, I decided to do 21 day fix. I have very specific recommendations. 1) Take before/after photos-they motivate you to see what you really look like and stay committed. They also allow you to see progress that the scale doesn't show. 2) Take measurements! Your body will lose fat and gain muscle first, which weighs a lot more than fat. The scale doesn't show results as fast as the tape measure! 3) Losing weight really is 80% diet and 20% exercise. You need to find a program that helps you with both at the same time. 4) I really recommend 21 day fix. It has both built in. If you sign up with a coach, you get added to a challenge group on facebook that comes with a whole group of people to vent to about struggles, get advice or recipes from, and who will hold you accountable and encourage you to follow the plan. People on facebook who are able to see if I did my workout and ate well that day helped me dramatically. I started 2 months ago. I have only lost 15 pounds but, I lost about 15 inches and 2 pants sizes. Everything is big on me and I fit in clothes I haven't been able to in years. I have definition in my arms and I am stronger every day. The results have been crazy fast and the eating plan is pretty simple after the first few weeks. If you want help, have questions, or need anymore info, contact me at *********@*****.***. I would also be happy to share privately some before/after photos. Or, if you want, e-mail me and we can be friends on facebook. This changed my life and it can change yours too! Whatever my results by my wedding are, I know that I will feel great because I will never look back at those photos with regret. I am doing everything I can to be healthy and fit!"

Often I think I look great and then see photos and feel terrible about myself! I cried uploading photos from our engagement trip to New Orleans and didn't post a bunch of them on facebook even though FH thinks I'm being ridiculous. I'm trying to lose at least a little but the holidays are just killing me.",
				"MacToBe: I am irritated with them too. The app going down before the holidays is stupid, and they planned this. The whole problem is they are totally changing the plan. No more Points Plus. I like what ive been doing for the past 5 years and really don't feel like learning a new program.",
				"I'm in a constant state of this feeling! Though, since I cut gluten out of my diet for health reasons, I've lost 8lbs in a month, and that was with little to no working out (because I'm the WORST at that). But when I got our e-pics back, I definitely had a moment of \"holy shit, am I *that* fat??\". Mentality can be a hard thing to fight, but as someone who has dealt with eating disorders for years, it's pretty vital. The more down on yourself about your weight you are, the harder it tends to be to lose weight or be happy with the way you look. It's always nice to know that those who care about me will love me no matter what my weight is! ETA: spelling",
				"@MacToBe- Thanks! We loved our pictures so much!! The only thing with bites is that it's a bit harder to find the right foods. Once you get the format down it's really easy to work with.",
				"I gotta say, I used to feel this way when I was pretty overweight, and I was so consumed with diet, working out, stressed on trying to lose weight, and counting calories was the worst decision, and it only made me gain more weight. The less I worry so much about food and exercise, the better I felt about myself. Someone who lost about 80 lbs told me that life is too short to 'worry'. You can still enjoy (some!) of the food, enjoy your work out, keep an active lifestyle and be completely fine. I'm not saying that you shouldn't care at all about being healthy, because you definitely should. But people who constantly stress out about losing weight only end up losing more confidence in themselves. OP, you definitely look great. Working out 4+ hours a day isn't really necessary in my opinion, but keep working out! To those of you who did shed the pounds and fat, congratulations to all of you! And to those who need motivation, good luck to all of you and stay confident in yourselves, because I believe that's the key to feeling good about yourself on your wedding day. I know my wedding is far from now, but I definitely felt the pain about losing weight struggles.",
				"I feel you gained forty pounds recently. Me and FH are starting a diet this weekend. Your welcome to join us.",
				"Oh, I've gained sooo much weight since the wedding 2.5 months ago. I thought that the threat of holiday parties would motivate me to keep it off, but nope. So now I have one week to feel good in a cocktail dress. And all I want to do is eat cookies...",
				"Yes struggling hard. For one my dress fits perfect so I'm in a I don't give a shit mood. And secondly its the holidays so yea. But when I get back from Puerto Rico January 11th I'm getting back to it! I tried on dresses for my FBIL wedding and felt like shit.",
				"@Kathryn - Yeah I quit like 12 hours before I found out they were also completely changing the plan and doing away with PointsPlus. My co-worker has been doing it with me and hasn't jumped ship yet but she's pissed. Point values for lots of foods she eats have gone up and they haven't given her any more regular points and actually TOOK AWAY 2 weekly bonus points. It makes no sense! @Salisott - You're totally right. It was kinda hard to find foods that were satisfying and filling --didn't make me feel like I was depriving myself all the time and would fall within my daily points. I feel like I have it down now though. I save my bonus points for wine! haha"

I am thrilled to be spending the rest of my life with the sweetest guy in the world, and he has in no way shape or form has even mentioned it. But I need to lose some weight. And I need some help. I am looking for someone else who is in the same boat to walk with me. I have a goal of 60 pounds before August 1st 2016. This gives me 4 months for my dress as the wedding is December 11th 2016 (The place I am ordering from has them done in 6 weeks) So I feel that will be enough time. Its a pretty realistic goal (1.5 pounds a week) but I have done this \"I AM GOING TO LOSE WEIGHT\" life changing revelation about 7 times in the past two years and now I really need to do it.

				"Hi there. I have been in a similar boat. I've been trying to lose about 40 before June. I started a couple of months ago and am up to 15 lost so far. If you put your mind to it and are truly committed, you can do it! You'll likely have set backs. The hard part, I've found is powering through those. If you fall off of the wagon, pick yourself up and hop right back on!",
				"It's possible. I lost 50 in 7 months. My main motivation was to get healthy, I don't want to die of heart failure. I personally think that you mentally need to want to do this, if you're just going to binge eat every night after doing great all day and never exercise nothing is going to change in that year - that's what I see with people in my office time and time and time again. In your heart of hearts, if you truly want to make it happen you will make it happen. We have a WW group on MyFitnessPal you can join that. We can send you friend requests and we can try to help you.",
				"How do I join ww group on My fitness pal?",
				"Is this weight you've always carried or only gained in recent years? IMO, if you've always been in a position where you could lose 60#, it's going to be a very hard road to achieve; you'd basically be becoming a person in 8 months that you've never been. I'm not discouraging you, I have just questioned these posts in the past and found that my idea of how to lose weight/be healthy is drastically different from many of the women here.",
				"Me, me, me! I'm trying to lose 55-60 lbs and I'd ideally like to lose it by July so that I have plenty of time for alterations (planning on going dress shopping in Jan/Feb and will just buy whatever size I fit into at that time). So, that gives me about 9 months. I started counting calories and sticking to around 1,200-1,300/day as of mid-October and I'm down 9.4 lbs as of this morning. I'm using the Lose It app to track food and weight. It has been great! You can tell it the rate you want to lose (max is 2 lbs/week) and it tells you how many calories to eat each day and adjusts daily depending on what you weigh in at. If I stay at the same rate of loss, it says I should meet my goal around late April, but I know it won't continue to come off this quickly.",
				"I have lost 55lbs in a year and a half. It's really slow for me. I would just focus on a lifestyle change, watching the amount of calories you intake and trying to be more active. You will lose weight that will stay off I would love to lose 40lbs before my wedding in May but I know it's not going to happen unless I do something really drastic and probably unhealthy for my body. It's just too unrealistic for me. I'm trying to focus on dropping 15lbs or so before then. Best of luck on your journey. We have had some amazing weightloss in this community!",
				"Http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/group/107811-weddingwire-brides",
				"It is totally possible. Ever since my daughter I gained weight and couldn't seem to shake it. I of course lost the weight almost immediately after birth, but not working out and eating junk food all the time I gained it all back (I had a fast metabolism back in the day and thought it would still be there lol) unfortunately my body went though changes after my daughter...and want to work back to my body before having her (of course I can't fully get it back considering since my daughter I have wider hips now). I started the 21day challenge from Autumn Calabrese in September and Now its November (I did sway from it however due to my doctor told me to stop because of a unexplainable twitch I've produced and he can't quite put his finger on whats wrong)....I can't say that I lost a lot of weight being its only been 3lbs (yes only 3lbs!! Sick I know)...however I noticed as well as everyone else I'm around that my body is becoming more lean and my dress size has gone down a little. I'm not necessary losing just fat, I'm more so gaining muscle.... So what I do wana say is that...it is possible, but do not expect to lose the weight over night (I admit I expected to see changes after a week and got discouraged) because it takes time....but also don't be discouraged because the pounds don't seem to be dropping...it maybe because your body is gaining muscle. I'm currently still trying to lose some weight by doing simple things like jogging (something the doctor will let me do)...and I do have cheat days---which is not all that bad, reading up on it is actually good....it sends a shock to your body because of the less calories your body is taking in (your body will eventually get use to the less calories and produce a lower rate of fat-burn) making it in a way jump start your metabolism.",
				"I have lost around 45lbs in 7 months. I want to loose another 15-25 before February to get in the healthy range for my weight, but if I don't, I'm ok with where I'm at. I've lost most of my weight with a change I diet (less calories, low carb, high protein and high fiber) and by using myfitnesspal. I also have a coach on fitocracy that helps me set both nutritional and workout goals. FH and I are loosing weight together, which has helped as well.",
				"Also you may want to look at the 21day challenge with Autumn Calabrese...it takes away from having to count calories, instead you get containers that you fill. You cook your own meals (saving you money in the long run) and whatever will fit in the containers given is what you can eat. That also has videos as well so you don't have to go to a gym and work out...you can work out right at home (kinda the reason I got it too...I don't have the money to spend on a gym membership so working at home and watching my daughter was/is great).",
				"I've lost about 85 pounds in a little over a year. It hasn't been easy but I did it with the help of a nutritionist and by exercising (I go to kickboxing at least 3 times per week and to yoga twice per week). I'm hoping to hit 100 by the time I have to go for alterations but my main goal really is just to be healthier and by extension, happier.",
				"@OP, it's really awesome that you want to do this, and definitely a good step to hold yourself accountable by letting the WW community in on your goals! You can totally do this! I'm putting in another vote for the 21 Day Fix, although, it would be very intimidating to start with this right off the bat. It might be better to stick to power walking/lower impact exercises first, then switch to a more intense program like this when you're about 30 lbs away from your goal. The work outs are SERIOUS. But super effective. And the portion control aspect is key, as well. This program definitely makes it really easy.",
				"60 lbs in 8 months is ambitious, but doable. You will have to be really strict for 8 months. No cheat days, No eating out, consistently exercising. You have to be very vigilant and you FH has to be on your side. He can't bring home pizza or buy a 2 liter of soda while you're trying to diet. He has to be a little bit mean. If you say \"I want chocolate ice cream.\" his response should be something like, arent you on a diet? And really it's not being mean, it's keeping you accountable. If you're serious about this, be serious. No days off. No telling yourself why 1 candy bar is ok.",
				"Hey Everyone! Thank you for the wonderful feedback! I truly appreciate all the honesty. As to the question pertaining to past weight issues. I have always been \"Curvy\" and have grown to love and accept that. Loosing 60 pounds would put me back to a comfortable and healthy weight that I was at about 4 years ago. The past 5 years have consisted of some serious trauma and I used food to comfort and defend myself. Now, with that said, I have always had a weight issue but I truly feel this is an attainable goal, although maybe not in the time frame I \"hope for\". My only true goal is to be happy, comfortable and able to go on hiking trips, kayaking and other adventure that I enjoy without feeling like I am going to die! LOL. I will look into the \"21 day challenge\" and incorperate it into my lifestyle change. Currently I have made a goal to visit the gym 3 times a week before work for 2 month, 4 times a week for 3 months and 5 times a week for the remainder of this adventure (and hopefully forever!) My SO is wonderful and has been nothing but supportive and loving and so I feel that even if I do not reach this \"Goal\" it will still be a wonderful journey. Thank you all for your sweet love and I am so excited to get on this. I hope to stay on this thread and update you all at least once a week to report my progress. Thank you for walking on this journey of accountability and life style change! Also, congrats to all you lovely brides past and present!",
				"That sounds amazing! Good luck!",
				"I am in exactly the same boat as you and you can do this! I was healthy four years ago when I met my FW and gained all 70 lbs back. I have lost some in the last few months but I am no where near my goal and I have less time than you do! Weight lifting gives you dramatic results. I am proud of you for wanting to change!",
				"Myfitnesspal has done wonders for me. I love it. Check out the community forums - they are full of advice and encouragement. My biggest piece of advice is to not lose at a rate that is not maintainable. Please don't set your calorie goal at 1,200 calories per day (unless you are over 50 years old and are short, like shorter than 5'1) or deprive yourself - people that make this mistake tend to be on a diet, rather than making a lifestyle change and the results will not last. I think that is one of the biggest mistakes people make. I've posted this before, but this is one of my favorite myfitnesspal success stories, because it's so true and so real: http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/discussion/1454303/2-years-of-maintenance-130-pounds-lost/p1",
				"@LMac Congrats Lady! You are awesome!",
				"I think it's doable with a lot of determination and very little cheating. Having your fianc\u00e9 support you and help you along the way will make a ton of difference. Also, don't get discouraged if the numbers on the scale don't seem to be moving. You might be losing inches. Also, focus on losing in a healthy way that you'll be able to maintain post-wedding.",
				"Nothing to add but change your avatar! The rings are associated with spam/trolls and it will help you get more responses",
				"I've lost weight following that heavily popular Instagram: Fitgirlsguide it seems like oh another one of those diets but its actually super simple to follow the meals are delicious and just like WW the community of girls motivating and helping each other is beyond wonderful!",
				"I have lost about 30 pounds since late July so I know how you feel. I actually used the app MapMyWalk and MyFitnessPal. I honestly think these apps helped me a lot to lose weight because it motivated me each day to go for two walks. My goal is at least 5 miles a day and its great. I do use a pill, which I shouldn't, but its surprisingly worked. Its body lab, from JLo. Its your choice to use something like that or not but I think the apps have more of an impact of how I lost weight because I was able to watch each and everyday how I ate and what kind of activity I did. I still use the app to this day and there are challenges on it.",
				"I am in the same boat December 10th 2016 wedding and I want to lose at least 50 pounds !, I have lost about ten so far with just changing diet and exercise I am hoping to keep the pace I am going and surpass my goal !! good luck to you sister !",
				"My suggestion would be to maybe look at eating habits and see what you can change - if your goal is to be healthier after the wedding, too, start looking for recipes that are better for you (I say this not knowing if you already have salad everyday for lunch or not). I would also suggest looking for classes to join (I go to one at a local church for a $1 donation). It's a lot easier to get someplace to workout by 7 or 7:30 then to work out around 7 or 7:30 on your own at home (in my experience).",
				"I just started my pre-wedding diet. I seen results in a little less than two weeks. I stopped drinking anything other than water and hot green tea without sugar. I cut out all sugar except natural sugar and I have stuck to fruits for breakfast, salads for lunch, and dinner I don't eat anything after 7pm. That alone has worked. I also downloaded an app called My Fitness Pal for calorie counting. I try to stick to 1200 calories and take the stairs when I can, and do plenty of walking. I hope this helps. We are here for each other.",
				"Thank you everyone for the sweet support. Congrats to all you girls who are on the right track! Its working slowly but surely.",
				"I've been using the app, My Fitness Pal. It really helps to be able to enter the food that you're eating in and get a better estimate of what you've been eating through out the day. I recommend this app to anyone who's looking to make a lifestyle change!",
				"Myfitness pal works, I actually have been in facebook groups with some of my old friends from college and some of my other random friends. I've really found this SUPER helpful, as it motivates me as I see their workout pictures, healthy recipes, etc... and I go on facebook more than myfitnesspal.",
				"Look into the Jessie's girl group. Jessie Hilgenberg is a fitness expert who helps ladies lose weight, be healthy, and get into phenomenal shape. There's even a facebook group of ladies who are doing it too, so you can have friends to hold you accountable. I'd also suggest taking pictures of yourself in a bikini every two weeks or so. That helped me to see progress even when I didn't notice it myself, and kept me from getting discouraged.",
				"I know this is an old post - but if you want to private message me - I could use serious accountability as well I start to do well - and then I fall back!!! My wedding is a few weeks before yours. I could check in with you weekly or a few times a week if you want.",

				"@Susan- Hey Lovey I tried to message you but it wont allow me to click on your profile, feel free to send me a message! thanks!",
				"I sent you a message through an email I found on your wedding website.",
				"I think you have a doable goal, especially with your positive changes you are making. As a trainer, I find that most women have the greatest luck with an endurance strength training program (like Power or BodyPump) in a group format. The endurance strength training bit will help you gain lean muscle (without bulk), and will protect your joints, etc, making any cardio training you do even more effective and healthful! Eat healthfully and be kind to yourself. Always be kind to you.",
				"Hey @Hillary - Thank you so much for the advice! I have an injured foot, would you suggest lap swimming as a good cardio/low impact start? I'm just afraid to cause any more injury to it. Thanks! @Susan - I got it dear! I will email you back asap! Thanks so much!",
				"@Marianne - Ouch! Your poor foot! Hopefully nothing serious! Swimming is a great way to combine cardio with resistance - I always turn to swimming when I really want to kick training into gear. I like this site because it lets you build on your progress - http://100swimmingworkouts.com/ - Swimming is a full body exercise (duh, Hillary), and so of course, you'll be hungry afterwards! Make sure you're refueling properly and not starving yourself! Building core strength is also a great way to get the most out of your other workouts - and protect your joints and the rest of you. I like the Blogilates series (you can access that on YouTube and on Facebook), because it can be modified for any fitness level. Hitting the stationary bike is also a good way to build strength and endurance, while protecting that foot. Just make sure you wear proper shoes so you don't hurt yourself further, adjust your bike to a proper height, and crank up that resistance - adding resistance will help you increase your fitness fast! I hope any of this helps at all. I think that your goals are reasonable, especially if you combine exercise with healthful eating. If you're looking for a diet - you could always go vegan :-P --- yes, I'm THAT person. But seriously, vegan eating changes your body FAST - if that's what you're looking for. I hope that you enjoy your fitness journey, and that you enjoy the months leading up to your wedding! BE KIND TO YOURSELF.",
				"Hey @HilaryKate! Thanks for all the tips! My foot is fine, I broke it when I was in high-school playing soccer with some friends (Surprise gopher hole! lol) So it doesn't hurt to bad unless I start doing something resistance heavy on it as it never quite healed right! Your fine the vegan talk! I need to do it (and go gluten free)... The few years I was a vegetarian were the best I have ever felt! Just gotta get on the train and ride it again!",
				"HONESTLY the best thing to do is get a Fitbit. I have done the same thing as you- had the \"omg I need to change my body\" revelation only to give up a week later when I saw chocolate. The Fitbit has totally changed my lifestyle- I've lost 24 pounds over the past 3 months. It counts all your calories, and all you have to do is set a deficit (I do 500 calories a day) and track what you eat. It's so easy and I honestly don't even feel like I've given anything up but have lost weight so easily. I was so scared/stressed about losing weight for my wedding but I'm only 3 pounds away from my goal now and I still have a little over 8 months to just \"maintain\" and not even stress about whether I'm continuing to lose! The Fitbit Zip is only $50 at Best Buy and the app is free- best decision I've ever made! Just walking and counting calories has made the weight just fall right off! I also cut out soda. And I allow myself one \"cheat meal\" every week (usually Saturday night date night)- it really allows me to not feel like I'm sacrificing anything. So, I really recommend the Fitbit",

If so, I'd avoid the really intense workouts (ie: Insanity or 21 day fix), cause sweating that much will really drastically affect your milk supply.

			"content": "I am getting married October 2015, so only a few months away. I just realized that I will be pmsing during my wedding and on my period the first week of my honeymoon. I'm not so concerned about being on my period because its a two week honeymoon and is what it is. However, I gain about 5-10 pounds of bloat when I pms and I really don't want to be dealing with that on the day of my wedding. Any suggestions? I'm thinking of waiting a week to take my next set of birth control pills after my cycle this week but I'm afraid that will completely throw off my cycle and might make things worse.",
			"comments": [
				"GIRL. I look multiple months pregnant right before my period so I get ya on the bloating. So you're on birth control pills? You should be able to just skip the placebo week over your wedding/honeymoon and just move straight into the next month of active pills, no problem. I wouldn't recommend waiting before you start the next month...I tried that once and it was disastrous with my hormones. Emotions, skin breakouts, craziness.",
				"I'm in the same boat as you. Talked to my doctor yesterday about it. I'm getting on birth control, I wasn't before, doctor said to skip the placebo week and just continue with the birth control pills.",
				"Randi, Yeah I'm thinking moving my cycle is probably going to do more harm than good. I might take the suggestion about going straight into the next set of pills to avoid my period, but that still leaves me with that awful bloat. I have the same problem as you, I literally look preggo. Maybe if I do wraps the night before and wear spanx that will help. It just shows on my face when I feel insecure about the bloat",
				"Liz, good to know a doctor said that it was safe to do. FYI, you're getting married on my birthday",
				"Hmmmm. If you're on birth control and you're skipping the placebo week, you shouldn't have any issues with bloating. Obviously I'm no doctor and know next to nothing about these things but I've never heard of that before. Can you talk to your doctor about it and see if she has any helpful tips for you to calm the bloating? I do know one thing for sure in your situation: drink water water water water water. Also, have you read the New to WW sticky post??",
				"Also, my doctor told me to skip the placebo week for my wedding as well--and then said I could do that multiple times if I wanted. She said it's important for a woman to have 3-4 periods a year, but other than that it's fine to modify with the pills.",
				"Sometimes I feel like my bloating starts a day or two before I stop taking my pill, but maybe that's in my head. I am going to be a water fiend the entire month before my wedding lol. I might take midol the day of too, just to help with any bloating that may occur. And no I had not, I will read that now. Thank you!",
				"No problem, Brooke! Welcome to the forums!",
				"Bloat is just water retention... take a diuretic with your next cycle to see if that helps you....they make OTC medications specifically for bloat.",
				"Dandelion tea is great for bloating",
				"Probiotic yogurt helps WONDERS with my PMS bloat. Something to think about. And I don't believe I'll be on my period for the wedding, but if I was worried about it, I'd just skip the placebo week. Women do it aaaaaaaaaall the time for weddings."

			"comments": [
				"My advice? Wait. I'm in the bariatric program here. Six to seven months in nutrition programs generally required before hand for insurance purposes (some have requirements that can take nine months), two to four weeks recovery afterwards and two years of hard work afterwards. It isn't a shortcut. It's a long, hard process and a major life change. Your doctor can advise you better than we can.",
				"Do you plan to have children soon? I was seriously considering it but I have seen so many people gain the weight back after children so I'm going to wait.",
				"If you have not already spoken to a doctor about this, generally speaking you must adhere to a regimen/doctor's nutrition plan for 6 months to a year before you will even be scheduled for surgery. Insurance also has to approve you as well which might also take 6 months to a year. I know that most physicians must have on record that you have been morbidly obese for 5 years or longer, have tried at least 3 diets with no real results, then they have you do weekly weigh ins and put you on a diet to make sure you are able to adhere to never being able to eat normal again/do what the doctor tells you, then you might need to have a psych evaluation (the intensity of this varies doctor to doctor), and enroll in some kind of general exercise program. You also must consider that many people who have weight loss surgery (including Lap Band) also have other issues that can complicate things such as adhesions (abdominal/ovarian), gallbladder blockages, diabetes, etc. that can result in a variety of complications that can result in hospitalization, additional surgery, drainage tubes, wound vacs, etc. Many people who have weight loss surgery also have their gallbladders taken out at the same time. You also have to take into consideration that your physician and/or insurance may not approve you for surgery. Of all the surgical procedures I have seen, the most hoops you have to jump through are with the weight loss surgeries.",
				"Myself and my FH have had the sleeve gastrectomy. I had it two years ago and he just underwent surgery 2 months ago. The program takes 6 months of nutrition classes, blood tests, counseling and appointments with several doctors who make sure your okay for surgery (EKG, Endoscopy, Sleep Apnea testing, etc). You also have to show weight loss progression during that time frame, it doesn't have to be a lot, but if you gain or just maintain weight they will not preform surgery. I will say that we both think surgery was the right decision for each of us. I have lost a total of 124 pounds, he has lost 42 since his surgery and is on track to meet his goal weight in six months (the doctor said men lose a lot more weight and faster). We both or no longer on any medications and many of our aches (back, neck, hips) have severely lessened or gone away entirely. I am also happy to report that my gyno thinks i am now in a great place to have a healthy and successful pregnancy (the surgery was actually recommended originally by my gyno). We both go to the gym 5-6 days a week, cook most if not all of our meals at home and generally enjoy supporting each other in a health lifestlye. Overall I would do it again in a heartbeat. Now as for this impacting your wedding here is some information, if you had the surgery in 6 months here is how it would impact you: You would have to be on a liquid and/or pureed food diet for 6 weeks-2 months after surgery You cannot have bread type products or drink alcohol for 6 months after surgery You have to make exercise a priority, walking immediately after surgery and increasing the impact and intensity of other exercise pretty soon after that. You cannot be submerged in water for two months No sexual activity for several weeks If you are willing to commit to this right before a wedding than I say go for it. Just make sure you will not be stressing yourself out, that is counter productive to healing and the wedding planning process.",
				"My friend had the band put in and within several months her body started to show signs she was rejecting it and she just had it removed. I would evaluate your diet, and see a personal trainer you have plenty of time before the wedding to get buff!",
				"If and when you get the surgery, get it for your long-term health, not to look good for your wedding. Everyone I know who has had the surgery has actually ended up more negative about their appearance than before they had the surgery. The issue is that your skin gets stretched by the extra weight, and does not return to normal even if you lose the weight. Your choices at that point are a) live with a lot of sagging skin all over your body, or b) have surgery to remove the excess skin, which will result in scars. Also be aware that the surgery is a lifetime commitment, not a short-cut. It has two effects that help to keep the weight off after the initial weight loss. The first is that getting rid of the extra weight relieves stress on your joints, making you more able to exercise. The second is that, depending on the surgery, it either cuts down on absorption of food or makes your stomach smaller to keep you from eating as much. As to the first, that helps only if you do in fact exercise. As to the second, you can develop nutritional deficiencies, some life threatening, if food absorption is cut down and you do not make sure to get the extra nutrients you will then need. If you have the type of surgery that makes you stomach smaller, it won't help if you then switch to eating high calorie foods more often. Given that wedding stress often makes it more difficult to maintain healthy eating habits and an exercise routine, you'll need to think about whether it really makes sense to start now. I have known a lot of people who have had weight loss surgery. The ones for whom it has been successful long-term are those that have made drastic lifestyle changes--working out regularly, watching their diet carefully. For them, it has literally been a life-saver. But don't treat it as a magic wand that will automatically solve your weight problems, without a lot of effort on your part.",
				"I seriously considered surgery but with hard work, diet and exercise, I've lost over 50lbs in the past 15 months. I still have at least 40 to go but I am glad I didn't do the surgery. It's hard for me to ever be/maintain a weight under 200 because I really do have bad genes as far as weight is concerned. MyFitnessPal has helped me the most. Also, everyone I know who has had surgery, ended up gaining it all back (even without kids)... that's a lot of money wasted and pain to just end up in the same body you were in before. ETA: Just got done creeping your pictures and you look great! I don't even know if you'd be considered a \"candidate\" for weightloss surgery. I love the picture of your FH grabbing your butt, hahaha. One good thing about some extra weight on us - a nice booty!",
				"MY best friend did this last year, but she had to do nutrition counseling before hand, have a physical and pass a psychological evaluation as well as attend several support group meetings. Her doctor also made her go on a special medical diet to lose a certain amount of weight prior to the surgery. She spent one night in the hospital and then went home. She has lost 186 pounds so far. She looks fabulous, but she has a TON of loose skin everywhere that will require a plastic surgeon to remove...and she knew that going into the process. She no longer takes any of her diabetes medications or arthritis medication because her knees are not under terrible stress any more. Keep in mind that she was morbidly obese...close to 500 pounds when she started this journey.",
				"Out of all the people I've ever met, one was successful and she's only one year out. Everyone has gained the weight back and added malnutrition issues. I lost 40 lbs doing HMR diet in 3 months and my mom (at age 60+) lost 150 lbs doing OA. Even if you choose to do the surgery, you're going to need a lot of psych work before hand and a lot of commitment to it afterwards.",
				"Of course we don't know your background, but the way you are phrasing it seems like you are wanting to do this to look good for the wedding. It's not a quick fix solution that just happens in one day and poof you're skinny and healthy. Like the others have described above, it's a process that requires medical evaluation, dieting, failure with lifestyle modifications and weight loss medications, and approval for surgery. Keep in mind everyone recovers differently. At my bariatric surgery hospital, I've seen patients develop complications that require a prolonged stay or readmission. I don't think this is something you want to chance before your wedding. If it is an option for you to consider, I would postpone this thought until after the wedding.",
				"Thank you very much @bethie it's funny because I'm definitely a candidate, bmi is way over",
				"I have the lapband and lost 70lbs. It took 7 months but that's not typical, I experienced a spike due to stress. I haven't had any complications from my procedure. Bariatric surgery isn't for everyone, do some research talk to your doctor. It's not an overnight fix.",
				"Hey there Mrs. Ford, I had bariatric surgery 13 years ago. It is THE BEST decision I've ever made. I went into my surgery weighing 308lbs, and I'm 5'3\". So I was REALLY heavy. My lowest weight was 158lbs, and I've gained about 30lbs back. I think that's pretty good for 13yrs. I still consider myself a HUGE success. For me..losing weight did more that help me fit into clothes. It helped my self-esteem. It motivated me to be healthy. It changed my whole life. I would have NEVER met my fiance at 308lbs. I feel sooo much better about myself. I always knew I was fabulous inside, but now I look fabulous outside. It took A LONG time for me to be approved, there were A LOT of hurdles including a psych exam, classes, nutritional classes. It took about 5 months for my insurance to approve it, then another 5 months on the surgeons waiting list. At 9 months, you should be feeling great!! The first 6 weeks are pretty painful, and you won't be moving around much. I think I took 3 months off of work. Hope this helps! Feel free to ask any questions."

Don't add extra salt into your food, use olive oil instead of butter and just be cautious. You'll be surprise how eating healthy can really help you. I lost 10 pounds by just trying to eat healthier without exercising, now I'm trying to do some more physical activities such as walking more, hiking and biking around the neighborhood. I got a little less than a year and I want to be down by 20-30 pounds. You can do it!!!",

I am going to try to find a local adult sports team to get back in shape since I hate the gym so much. I gained a bunch of weight recently as well, but I don't care how my body looks. I would just like to be able to run around without feeling like I am going to die.",
				"Cut out sugar and white carbs as much as possible (no bread, whole wheat low-carb wraps instead of bread, no cupcakes etc.), drink lots of water and increase your fruits/veggies. Try Myfitnesspal it's free. Also, try and walk at least 30 minutes a day (maybe during a lunch break or right after work before you even go home). Once I get home, I don't want to do anything else, but if I walk before work or right after work before going home, it's done.",
				"I bought my wedding dress one size too small (my desired weight) which is motivating me hard. It does have seam allowance so if I am unsuccessful I can get it tailored to fit. In all honesty, working out is good but it really is what you eat that makes the most difference, both combined is the ultimate. Whatever you do don't jump in the deep end, don't say \"That's it! I'm just going to eat veggies and chicken, and by the end of the summer I'll be doing a triathalon!\" You'll lose steam fast and not achieve your goal. It's best to start slow, change a meal a day to something super healthy and work your way up, and slowly decrease your portion sizes. Also start slowly at the gym , try everything at least twice to see if you love that exercise and when you find the exercises that you find fun and primarly do those. Eventually if you can start strength training (weights), that's just as important as cardio, and really helps tone the body.",
				"Also, let your environment inspire you if that's possible. Today I was going to take my dog on his normal routine morning walk but when I got outside it wasn't too hot and just a beautiful day, so we walked 3 miles around the lake instead! I was only going to do 1 mile. You have to make time to work out. It's really really hard, I struggle daily too",
				"Water water water. Drink lots of water, portion control, and exercise. I lost 132 pounds with weight watchers and walking. You can do it!",
				"My doc had me see a nutritionist after a major illness, she told me lean proteins, low fat, as little processed/fast food as possible, cut WAY back on sugar (as in little as possible), cut WAY back on carbs (focus on only eating complex carbs when I do eat them but even that should be in small amounts), major veggies, major water, and light on the fruit because fruit contains a lot of sugar. And try to write down what you eat because that will force you to pay attention to it. I like MyFitnessPal because it tracks the nutritional content as well as the fat and carbs and weight loss stuff. I have lost over 30 pounds since my surgery in September. My fianc\u00e9 got inspired to join me in getting healthier and started following this program but less strictly and he's lost over 30 since February. All basically without working out. That will be the next step... Toning.",

				"Like the other girls stated, the most important thing is what you're eating. Try to replace your largest meal of the day with a salad, cut out all junk food and only drink water. These 3 things alone will make a difference. After you've gotten used to that then you can start eating more clean. It's definitely a process. A couple of years ago I lost 50 lbs. I gained 10 back now & i'm beating myself up about it. I hate working out so on the days FH and I are free at the same time, we go on long walks. We talk about everything and I completely forget i'm burning calories lol. On the days he's working, I walk on my lunch break with a coworker. Anything is better than nothing. Good luck I know you can do it",
				"I also didn't have a lot of motivation before a few months ago. What helped was FH and I both dieting at the same time. I second using myfitnesspal to track what you are eating and to count macros. It gives a suggestion of how many calories, carbs, fats and protein you should eat each day based on how much you want to loose. I use fitocracy to track my workouts. It turns it into a game giving you points based on what exercises you do. They also offer coaching (both diet and excercise) for a fee if you choose that service. I do have a coach but have been bad about getting workouts in. I've lost 25lbs since beginning of April using both of those tools. Eating healthier really does make a difference.",
				"I'm NOT a morning person what so ever but I started working out in the morning and it gave me so much energy through out the day.

				"Also look on Pinterest at the portions and foods for the 21 day fix plan. I'm doing a combination of 21 day fix and Myfitnesspal. You can buy the kit with the containers or just look on Pinterest (lots of free tips and portion sizes there). It's a great food plan that teaches you how much you should be eating and in what portions. Basically it cuts out white carbs but still allows things like rice, potatoes, whole wheat breads etc. and teaches you how to eat balanced meals. The workouts are hard, and hard to keep up with (for me), but combined with calorie counting I'm eating so much healthier just by realizing the processed foods and breads I was eating weren't helping me at all, even though I was still counting calories. I was getting those calories from crap food.",

I did the 21 day fix last year and lost 11 lbs in 21 days, so I am considering getting back on board with that as well.

				"Erika! I just broke through some huge psychological barriers and painful baggage (eating disorders/body image issues/blah blah blah) and lost 30 lbs, and still have 15 to go but am now so confident it'll happen. You. Can do. It. You ask about how to be motivated. Something that really hung me up in the past when I was trying to lose weight is that I hated my body and hated myself for not having what I felt was a beautiful body. Working out was torture, a punishment for chocolate and yummy food. Discouragement drove me to eat my feelings, which drove me to try (and fail) to brutalize myself in the gym to make up for it. It was a vicious cycle, and I hated it. Hated every part of it, and myself, too. Then FH came along, and he really helped me work through a lot of those issues. He helped me shift my mindset and STOP looking at myself as ugly. He helped me feel beautiful as I was--but also, in the end, you can't just rely on a man's word alone to make you feel beautiful (although words of affirmation from your SO are hugely important, whether it's your love language or not!). But FH gave me the key to shift the way I looked at myself. And that's the thing--you've got to change the way you look at yourself. For me, I stopped hating my body and trying to punish myself. I started wanting to love and care for my body, and I started allowing myself to think maybe it could be beautiful just as it was, imperfections and all. I had thought forever that I would lose weight eventually, and that would make me finally feel beautiful. But it never happened. To my surprise, once I started letting myself believe I was beautiful as I already was, I was able to shed the weight. You are YOU already, beautifully and totally you, just as you are. Not minus 30 pounds. Love yourself. Love your body. Work out to improve your life and take care of your body--it's the only one you get, and it's special! It deserves some serious TLC for putting up with you your whole life. For the first time in my whole life, I now feel completely comfortable and happy in my own skin. I was CONVINCED that could never ever ever happen to me. But it did. And it CAN happen for you too! You just have to embrace it. I hope this wasn't weird to share or anything. I just see so many girls hating their bodies like I did, and it hurts my heart because I remember how that feels, and I remember the pain of it. Erika, I believe in you! You can totally do this.",

Drinking lots of water and eating high fibre foods (ie whole grain/veggies instead of white) will help you feel full longer. Also, EAT BREAKFAST! It kick starts your metabolism. Breakfast with some amount of protein is the best. The easiest for me is greek yogurt. With exercising, focus on core strength over cardio. Don't cut out cardio, but the focus should be on strength.",

				"Okay SUPER LONG POST ahead. I posted this before in a weight loss question back in March. I've lost about 20lbs in 4-5 months and have been maintaining at my \"happy\" weight for a month now. I'm working on leaning out right now as well as training for a half. Here's what works for me: It's all about calories in vs calories out for weight loss, but it's also important to exercise to get \"lean\" and \"toned\". Here's what's worked for me so far: I've lost 7lbs and 6.7% body fat through a blend of strength training and cardio at my gym since January (a total of 15 lbs down since September... my GW is 20lbs down which would put me at what I was throughout HS and college). My gym offers personal training with their membership (which is a great deal), and they design my workouts every six weeks. A lot of my workouts are similar to \"The New Rules of Lifting for Women: Lift like a Man, Look Like a Goddess\". You can also find some great beginner workouts for strength training on bodybuilding.com. I also love http://www.blogilates.com/. At my gym, I weigh in and they also take down my measurements (inches and body fat%) and log it in the system so I can see my gains over time which helps me keep accountable to myself. I have friends at work who go to the same gym and we keep each other motivated. I also joined several challenges. Finally, I have a fitspo tumblr account and post when I have small gains or minor set backs (this is what I've found that works best for me to keep track of gains/setbacks). These are things that work to keep me accountable. Find what works to make you accountable. I also took a nutrition class at my gym to make sure I was on track. I don't keep any sweets or snack foods in our house because I know I'll eat them all (*eats all the chocolate*). I meal plan and use a grocery list to buy only what we need and that way I'm not tempted to buy sweets/treats/unnecessary stuff. Since I'm not a huge breakfast person, I drink an 8oz protein shake and have black coffee. I also drink loads of water. My other favorite is to have a glass of crystal light lemonade at dinner which replaces the soda I use to drink. If I *really* need a soda and don't want coffee, then I'll drink a diet (but I only drink like one a week...) I have a notepad underneath my monitor that I write my goals on and update them every 1-2 weeks. I have short term and long term goals. Even if I'm not feeling motivated, I make myself go to the gym. It's a commitment for me to go to because it's the closest gym and it is 20 miles away. So if I make the trip (which I do 4-5 times per week), then I actually make the workout count. I keep a gym bag in my car stocked with clothes, toiletries, and water. There's no magic pills. It's not always easy. And it's a slow process. But if you make goals, stay accountable, and make small changes to your life, then it is feasible. Let me know if there's any way I can help! I love meeting new people to stay accountable with. Here's my fitspo/weight lose tumblr account: http://emaebe.tumblr.com/",

I adjust if I am super tired/busy, but I am more committed to strength and building muscle than riding the bike for 15 kms. I just went dress shopping, and I was in between sizes (16 in the chest, close to 12 everywhere else), she said if I got the 14 that \"it would be incentive to lose weight!\" (and I wanted to punch her), but I am trying to accept the body I have, and I would hate to get the dress and not be able to zip it up. If I lose weight, I can always take it in, so no worries. But if I build muscle, I might not go down any sizes anyway. Remember not to look at the scale, because 1 lb of muscle looks different than 1 lb of fat. Look at inches and look at how happy it makes you feel.",

That gave me the body love and boost I needed to treat myself better.",

I am trying with the water thing (but to drink half my weight in oz a day in water just makes me pee ALOTTT) lol I am buying a fit bit this week, I'm really excited about that But i would have to say start by drinking lots of water, if you can incorporate fat burning fruits such as grapefruit and kiwi as snack i'd suggest that. (Be careful with Grapefruit tho, i know if conflicts with certain medications). Make a pinterest board they have a gazillion recipes to help with healthier eating. I also struggle with time, I am a case manager and my job is so stressful and mentally exhausting sometime i just wanna come home, lay down and stare at the ceiling. I try to motivate myself by going to Zumba. I like dancing and once i leave there I'm pumped so ill try to work out a little more in the gym before going home. Walking also does wonders as well. Last summer i lost a lot of weight from walking 2 miles a day around 4 days a week.",

The nxt week only water, a walk & a healthy breakfast. The nxt week increase the walk length 50%. The nxt week add lunch healthy. The nxt week start jogging half & walking half. The nxt week add healthy dinner 3 nights a week.

Take small steps like. Hey this month I plan on losing 5lbs and cut out this one food. If you try too much at one time you are guaranteed to fail. Good luck on this. I have to get back into the groove but lost so much ambition suet several deaths in my family.",

I noticed a big difference also when I made protein the main portion of my meal. For lunch have a salad with chicken, dressing on the side! Dinner have meat with a vegetable and if you need a starch, stick to measuring 1 cup, this should be a good portion size. If I don't have the motivation to work out, I'll do jumping jacks and squats during commercials when I'm watching tv... sounds funny but you can actually feel it the next day!",
				"This may sound crazy but go out an buy workout clothes. But the trick is really really cute workout clothes. It is going to be spendy but i promise you it is worth it. If you get clothes that you love you will want to wear them and therefore you workout. Go for a run, bike...whatever you want, just GO. That is what i did and it got me motivated to get to the gym 5 days week. To keep it going for every xxx Lbs you lose get something new. I personally set mine at 5 lbs lost = new top or shorts. Sites i like....Lululemon, Fabletics, Lucy, Victoria Secret, Forever 21...it's endless"

The last 2 months have been hell again, with pain every day, and I'm having to take painkillers on a more frequent basis than I'd like. I'm having a procedure done next week to see where/how bad the blockage is...and then there might be another surgery. I'm terrified that I either will not be in good enough shape to actually walk down the aisle (recovering from surgery) or if we put it off till after the wedding, that I'm going to be in excruciating pain during what should be the best day of my life.. Just a general rant, really...I know my doctors are doing all they can to help me. I'm just tired of the pain, and don't want it to ruin my wedding day.",
			"comments": [
				"I hope your procedure goes well I've never had any problems like that so I can't relate, but my mom has had multiple surgeries for kidney stones - she's like a freaking stone factory and have seen her in a lot of pain. I wish you the best!",
				"I'm in the exact same boat with you. What procedure are they doing? I got lithotripsy which was a dream come true for about a month until new stones formed. I haven't even thought about being in pain on my big day. But with kidney issues and fibromyalgia I'm pretty good at sucking it up and pretending to be okay. ETA if you have stones around your wedding time go in for lithotripsy about a week before and you shouldn't have any pain.",
				"I had the lithotripsy done, and haven't had stones since, but I have hydronephrosis, so basically my kidney is swollen due to my ureter wall collapsing and causing a blockage. The procedure next week is just a contrast test (not an MRI or CT) to see the blockage. After that they'll do a reattachment of my ureter to my kidney. I'm hoping that they can do another robotic pyloplasty, so I'm not out of work for a month. 2 weeks recover with robotic/laproscopic procedures... Thank you for the encouragement. It sucks. I'm in agony at work right now, needing a percocet, but it will knock me out. I really was hoping for a nephrectomy, hoping that they'd just take the kidney, but it still functions really well...pain isn't a good enough reason to take it out.",
				"Beg them to take it out? Not that that ever works, I've tried..",
				"Nephrectomy!? I wouldn't go that route...Pretty scary. Good luck though. Hope you're 100% healthy for your wedding and of course for good!",
				"FutureMrsPereira, yeah, the whole thing is...I'd almost rather be rid of the darned thing than be in pain all the time, but if what they're going to do next fixes it, then I will DEFINITELY keep it. Thanks for the well wishes everyone.",
				"Sending good vibes your way! I hope everything goes well for you.",
				"I had a kidney stone on my wedding day and throughout the honeymoon and I was sooooo thankful that it didn't bother me one bit through it all. I have no idea how. I had to have surgery like two weeks after the wedding to get it removed though! Best of luck you though! It sucks!",
				"You've got plenty of time before your wedding, so try not to stress too much! Hoping the next few months go well for you",

				"I know all about kidney transplants, but nothing about what you're going through. If one of your kidneys is perfectly healthy, than why not remove the one that is creating an issue? In the long run, the insurance company would save money if it is removed. My grandfather was born with 1 kidney and he lived well into his 90's. He lived off of traditional Italian food and candy. I can't believe how long they lived in that diet lol. I wish you nothing but the best girly. I'm still struggling with my kidney function, but slowly I'm getting through it.",
				"Well, you've got some time. You have tests and procedures that are intended to make you well and pain free. If it turns out that you are still in pain by the summer and no procedures have alleviated your chronic pain, it will be time to talk to your doctor about pain management.",
				"As a person living with one kidney my BIGGEST FEARS in life are 1. If GOD FORBIDS my children ever needed one i can't help them even if I were a match and 2. If something happens to my only kidney I have to do dialysis while I wait for a transplant. That is super scary to me. I pray that whatever procedure they'll do next will work so you can live a healthy, pain-free life!! XOXO",
				"Thank you all SO much! The reason they won't take the one that's giving me issues is that its still perfectly functional. My left one is performing 51% of the work, and the right 49%, so they're working pretty evenly, even though the problem one is slightly less. I can't wait for next week, to start getting some answers. My fella is being super supportive through everything, even though he hates that he can't make me better. I'm stressing out a lot less now. Thank you all for the kind words and well wishes."

				"I have to lose about 60. I have been walking with a friend, and I've also started on some doterra slim and sassy, which is an all natural combination of essential oils that help to lose weight in a healthy way with no jittery side effects of most diet pills. A friend of mine sells it. It is a natural appetite suppressant, and helps to balance your glucose levels! It's fairly inexpensive, and can be found at most health food stores!",
				"100 pounds in 4 1/2 months is unrealistic, in my opinion. Why not try to lose a pound a week and put off dress shopping until you feel a bit more confident. You have plenty of time.",
				"I agree with AprilBride. 100lbs is an awful lot in that amount of time. Strive for 1-2lbs per week. There are lots of free calorie counting websites to try out like Myfitnesspal and Sparkpeople. Great forums like their are here which give you support like they would a ww meeting. I'm want to lost 50lbs myself, we can do it!",
				"And, I do agree with the ladies...100 pounds is a bit unrealistic in that amount of time, and would be very unhealthy for your body. Definitely aim for small amounts per week, and just do your best. You don't want to set your goal so high, that you can't reach it. That would just discourage you. Stay positive, and try to think happy thoughts, as stress will also make you retain weight! Praying for you and wishing you the best of luck!!",
				"Really, aiming for anything more than 1-2lb a week is unhealthy and means you're more likely to put that weight back on. Personally, I've had good experiences with WeightWatchers (online only version. shockingly, the only thing that's helped me shed medication weight and worked with my activity limits) and drinking green tea/eating lots of smaller meals with low calories. MyFitnessPal is a great app to help keep track of things.",
				"Low carbs and walking 30 plus minutes a day would be a good start. Keep fats to healthier fats too. Set smaller goals every 4-6 weeks. Seems to help.",
				"Stop eating junk (processed foods, fast food, super-sized restaurant foods, sodas), switch to clean foods (lean meats, veggies, low-fat diary) and start exercising - walking, videos, etc. You can easily lose weight for free.",
				"Firstly - 100 pounds is absolutely unhealthy and unrealistic in that short amount of time. Lose what you can, but set a more realistic goal; you don't want to get discouraged by not being a size 2 within a few months (exaggeration). Do you have a Planet Fitness near you? The membership is only $10 a month, and they have multiple free training classes every single day. They have different classes focusing on different areas, and there are special \"design-your-own\" classes where you tell the trainer what areas you need to focus on and get a special routine. Start off slow, because if you make too drastic a change in your routine you'll get burnt out very quickly and are likely to give up. Start going to a gym 3 times or so a week, and on the other days do light cardio (walking) for 20 minutes or so.",
				"On YouTube there are many exercise videos. If you don't have weights fill empty milk jugs with sand or water. Or look at garage sales for exercise items, usually pretty easy to pick up a few items. I'd also check Groupon for gym deals or boot camp deals. Good luck with your weight loss, but please be safe!",
				"Losing weight is FREE! Exercise daily, limit your portions, eat healthy. Lots of fruit and vegetables, limit starches (potatoes, pasta and bread). Cut out soda and fast food (it's never necessary). You don't even need a gym membership, go to Walmart and get a few hand weights. Cardio- running/jogging is wonderful exercise and totally free.",

				"You can do it!!!! I started weight watchers and lost 73lbs in 9 months. Just be careful about what you eat and make sure you move around more. Even if you only have 20 free minutes take a walk it really makes a difference",
				"High protein, sugar free, and exercise.",
				"Eat breakfast! Even if it's 1/8 cup of almonds... you'd be surprised how much almonds fill you up. EDIT: and hickory smoked almonds, in my opinion, tastes kinda like bacon! Sometimes you have to make sure to only eat a small amount because they do fill you up, even though you want more. What I did was buy a pound ($8 apprx) and measured it out in 1/8 cup portions in little baggies with makes about 15 servings... 15 breakfasts for only $8 is pretty good, I think",
				"(cough cough... I am by no means an expert but I have lost 4 lbs since Feb, when I got really serious- but a couple years ago I won the biggest loser at school bc i lost the most body fat percentage). As far as affordable I would say start cutting back in small ways one at a time, that way you budget can adjust, bc healthy food is not cheap. I'd start w/ soda/pretty much anything thats not water and switch to water which is usually free or bottled is still cheaper than soda. Then keep a food \"dairy\" track of what you eat and spend the most on (fast food, dining out, this place that place) then cut them one by one starting w/ the unhealthy place you eat the most or item you buy the most. From getting off your regular eating routine you'll lose weight. Then walk, which is also free. There are lots of free training apps to give you workout ideas you can do at home or outside with no equipment. Once you've cut back on your eating to where you've intergrated a healthy diet fully then I would maybe try a prescribed diet (that tells you what to eat and how much). Those almost never work right off the back, bc its hard to go from eating whatever to strict you'll likely quit or get down on yourself for not being perfect. I find it better to change incrementally.",
				"I'm an insulin dependent diabetic, so losing weight can be difficult since insulin can easily put weight on...so I tried Shaklee. It helped me with my portion control and I'm better at counting calories. I highly recommend it.",
				"You can do it! (Not 100 pounds by August but 1-2 pounds per week) Check out Myfitnesspal, they have a great calorie counting system that's toally freen and a great forum for support, tips, recipes etc. Also Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred is a great starting video to get you moving and under 30 minutes so easy to work into a schedule. Try to get your FH/FW on board as well. Losing weight with someone else helps a lot!!",
				"I'll jump on board with the \"you need more realistic goals\" chorus. In more practical advice: A calorie deficit is the *only* way to lose weight. Counting calories using an app (free) like My Fitness Pal will help you assess your current food intake and work to set limits that will keep you healthy while still letting you lose weight. Other advice: If it's not just *weight* that you want to lose, but rather *inches,* strength training is going to help you lose fat faster than just calorie restriction and cardio. I can't recommend the amazing community at reddit's /r/xxfitness highly enough--the FAQs there can help anyone get started (and they're free) and the community is unbelievably supportive."

I realized what was going on in time, got back to eating better and got my color and energy back for the wedding. in short, don't do this to yourself, it's silly and not worth it. personally I suggest taking some bike rides or things like that. things for heath, and you could loose weight in the process. even if you don't, who doesn't need more energy and better health when they are a bride healthy looking is always more attractive in my book!",

It's providing the same calories as an average day, just in a highly nutrient delivery.

It will cause cramps, and you'll think you're getting your period every time you drink it, but it takes at least 3-5 days, so if you're going to do this, do it NOW. And you have to keep drinking it, like 5 cups a day - and you will feel like your period is coming every single day, but for some girls, it's 3 days, some it's 5, some longer, and some it doesn't work. I made it through 3 days before I was too disgusted to continue and didn't induce it right away, but it did come 3 days early, which was fine for me b/c I wanted to get past the worst cramps day (day 2 for me) before a vacation.

				"Yes. I only lost 40LBS when my goal was 100LBS. The month before the wedding was when it really hit me that I wasn't going to reach my goal in time (duh!). I practiced a lot of self-love that month. It consisted of shopping, salon, and wine. Lots of wine.",

				"Me!!! Not a huge endeavor, but I was hoping to get back to the lowest weight I've been as an adult (158....I'm about 165). Didn't happen. With 2 months out, I'm just going to be more active, do more pushups, and try to eat better",
				"I didn't drop 2 dress sizes like I wanted but I did have GREAT arms for my wedding courtesy of my trainer. And I had a corset back that sucked in/hid what I considered to be the trouble spots. DH told me I was the most beautiful girl he's ever seen no matter if I was a 2 or a 12. If you're confident, stand up straight with your shoulders back you'll rock the dress and look amazing!",

We splurged big time on photography and didn't even get e-pics bc I hated how I looked. Well, now it's only gotten worse. Nothing I can do at thus point.",

				"I still have some time. although my first dress fitting is next weekend and i am so not where i wanted to be by that appointment. lol. at the beginning of the year i was like, 'OK! gonna start this work out routine. gonna get in shapppe. gonna be a hot bride. oh yeah.' then i kept saying, 'oh, next week. i'll start next. i have so much time.' lol. yeaaah. i mean, i'm not trying to lose tons of weight. i'm just trying to tone. at this point, i'm being realistic. i'm me. i'm lazy. and whatever. lol.",

I'm telling myself it's muscle because I have been working out. My dress fits which is the important part and I'm just trying not to stress about how fat my face will be in photos.",
				"Not weight loss but I did say I was going to go to the tanning bed for the month before our wedding (really didn't like the idea of a spray tan), now I'm 9 days out and still pale, and it's too late for me to do a spray tan trial (I've never done a spray tan before and I'm too scared I'll wind up orange if I don't know for sure what color they should do). OH well!",
				"Best. Username. EVER. I tried working out for about five seconds. That didn't work. I'm pretty sure that I lost anywhere from 7-10 lbs. in the last week before the wedding and it was ALL due to stress.",
				"You didn't FAIL at all! OMG - you've done something amazing! 40 pounds?! Seriously? That's like 5 dress sizes! I did the math and though with all the stress of wedding planning and a new job, it was utterly unrealistic for me to also tackle weight loss simultaneously, even if I should do it for my health as much as wedding photos. My weight has fluctuated over the years, and sadly I was thin only when I was the sickest with my chronic illness... my metabolism is so jacked by now, I honestly only care that I'm healthy and not in pain. I literally spent 8 months where I had stomach pain every. single. day. It suuuuucked. So I'm rooting for ALL of us to have some self-love on this one. I'm totally with Janeen and RequiresSnacks!",

Then I stopped dieting and started eating whatever in the hell I wanted. I think the week before my wedding I had McDonald's like 3 times in a week and I never do that! In my defense, I was busy as hell the week before and didn't have time to meal plan. Not to mention, broke. That dollar menu was callin' my name! My dress still fit and we had an awesome time that day so eff it.",

But I just can't resist at times. I just don't want to look like a marshmallow on my wedding day!!!!",
				"I wanted to drop down to 160lbs for the wedding but went down to 185lbs but was 195lbs on my wedding day. Oh well. For the most part I didn't look/feel fat which was what I was trying to accomplish at the end of the day.",
				"Well this thread kinda links back to my thread about 6 weeks ago. I started bootcamp 6 weeks ago with the plan of losing 20 lbs then going dress shopping. Well needless to say, I DIDN'T lose 20 lbs but, I'm still going dress shopping. I've officially joined the IDGAF club! Plus I ate some ice cream last night :-)",
				"This happened to me.....my goal was 50lb and only lost 25 in the beginning but managed to keep it off. I HATE working out, so I just ate better. Im 16 days out and say I don't care! Im not obese by any means so oh well. My dress is a tie up, and makes me look SUPER skinny....just my arms are what I stress out about. But thats why I will do some creative poses to hide them lol. I bought bikinis for my honeymoon (FHs request since I haven't worn one in years), and im wearing them regardless! ! I'm in the IDGAF club!",
				"Totally me. I gained 20 or so over the past couple of years due to some major life events/stress. I'm not big by any means, but I've had a hard time adjusting to dressing my new size. I wanted to get back down for the wedding, but every attempt has been a fail. FH swears up and down that he likes me better now than when I was thin, so I'm trying to love myself as I am.",
				"I killed myself in the gym, but then pretty much ate whatever I wanted. The whole thing was counter-productive lol. Oh well.",
				"I have a little over 10 months before the wedding and I'm really hoping to lose some weight. Not even so much for the wedding, but just because I'm the heaviest I've been since right after having my daughter 7 years ago FH just bought me Zumba (at my request) so now to find time to actually do it between working full time, going to school, raising a 7 year old and spending time with FH. At least he said he'd try it with me and my daughter loves to dance. Hopefully I can lose some of the 50 lbs I'd like to lose.",
				"Same thing here...I have lost about 20 lbs, but I tore my meniscus in my right knee 5 weeks ago, and am only now able to get back to the gym (1 month before the wedding). Luckily only gained back 5 lbs...but I'm way off my original goal... Luckily I'm wearing a ballgown so tummy will be hid and because I haven't been able to use my legs, my arms have toned up..but no where near my goal...",
				"I'm trying so hard to lose weight. 45lbs down since April 2014, goal is 100lbs down by next October. I'm so scared I won't make it!",
				"My dress fit when I ordered it in January. It won't zip up now. I don't know how much weight I've gained but I can attribute it to the prednisone I've been taking since July for allergies. I went on a sugar detox last month and I'm trying to continue eating that way with small cheats and hope my dress fits. Otherwise, I'm going to have to shell out $$$ to alter it. :-/",
				"Agree with Staci! Two thumbs up!!",
				"Staci's message is nice. Sometimes I start feeling very desperate, and FH just asks me, \"Why are you so hard on yourself?\" I think we are all hard on ourselves, sometimes. That being said, I still have 11 months to make my goal. I don't want to go crazy low, so I'm setting my goal at a reachable 20lbs. Well I've lost about 5 so far, so it's 15lbs now. I've always struggled with my weight, but when FH and I started dating I was (at least) 15lbs lighter, and I want to get back there. Even if the rest of the weight doesn't come off, I'm getting back into healthier habits! And I hope, even if I don't make my goal, I will be balanced and calm about it.",
				"I am SO glad someone posted this. I only wanted to lose like 20 lbs - given the fact that I'm 60lbs overweight, that's not much. I figured \"realistic\" right? It didn't happen. I put off my fittings as long as I possibly could and then sucked it up and realized it is what it is. I figure I'm going to look awesome anyway, and I'm hoping my photographer can edit out a few lbs in the photos. Oh well.",
				"I gave up after 2 months. I literally said, \"F**k it, I don't care enough.\"",
				"I pretty much gave up on my weight loss after 4 months... I lost 30lbs and a ton of inches with a personal trainer... I am gaining it back now though.. Dress was to big at my first fitting though!!! In a way I wish it wasn't... It's given me the \"IDGAF what I eat my dress was to big\" syndrome... I am kicking myself in the ass now ... as I shit here with a cupcake from our wedding cake baker wondering why my skin isn't as clear as it was in past months....... sigh... stress.",
				"My \"this dress will look awesome if I lose pounds\" turned into \"how firm does bridal shapewear come in?\" I think I've gained about five pounds.",
				"@Karen: \"I put off my fittings as long as I possibly could and then sucked it up and realized it is what it is.\" I did the exact same thing! This is a fabulous post, thank you, RequiresSnacks :-)",
				"Yeah I intended to loose weight back in March..and did....but then the summer got insane and I worked 7 days a week and Ice Cream became my favorite!!! and now I swear I am heaver than I was this spring..and only 6 weeks till the wedding. I love me as I am but was hoping to get a little tinier for wedding photos.",
				"Ugh this is me! We got engaged and I put off dress shopping. Finally did it with plenty of time and through miscommunication a smaller size got ordered for me. (Just a size and a half) Stubborn me thought I can do this! And I sort of have been doing okay... well...the first dress fitting is next Thursday. I can't zip up the dress. It fits through the hips and stomach but my chest area is just still too big. I know I have 9 weeks but I'm sure the appointment will not go well with my mom (she knows it doesn't zip) and now I feel even more pressure. FH keeps telling me I've done so well because I've lost almost 20 lbs but I need maybe 15 more? Who knows! Thinking about it makes me want to cry :*(",
				"I lost 40, 3lbs away from my goal weight... then gained 10 back the month of. I'm a stress eater. Oh well.",
				"When I went dress shopping I was training for a half marathon and eating pretty well. Since then I have hurt my foot, so I haven't been running, which makes me depressed which makes me eat. Plus wedding stress drives me to drink. So pretty much I sit on my ass drinking beer and eating pasta. I had my first fitting a few weeks ago and it took two people to get me in. Tight as hell. Seriously. Can't. Breathe. So now I'm sitting here drinking beer and eating my daughters left over pasta stressing about the fact that my dress might bust the fuck open as I'm saying my vows. Great. Now I need another beer. Edited because my phone is a prude and didn't like me to use the f word and auto corrects it to duck.",
				"Yea, I hear you. I didn't lose what I wanted to, in fact my dress was snug at my final fitting. But then I ended up needing an unexpected and quick day surgery 3 days before my wedding :/ and after that I had no appetite and dropped 4 pounds. Dress fit perfect lol",
				"Maybe not what you want to hear, but my first reaction was that maybe it's a blessing in disquise. I had a plan to loose slowly, had a dress pretty much all done with my old figure. expecting it to be all set by the last month, just needing the last minute minor alterations. (making my own dress) then 3 relatives died over about 8 weeks, including my dad. quickly dropped about 4 sizes and my dress didn't work anymore. that and I think the lack of nutrition took it's toll on me, including my skin and a few teeth. I'm picking up the pieces now, finishing up my new dress (all is going smoothly) but I really do wish it happened differently. slower weight loss to say the least. and of course, no family deaths. I used to work in photo labs, and you could always tell the brides that went on crash diets. their skin wasn't as nice looking, they looked more tired, you get the idea. you've got 8 days left, i'm sure you look beautiful. forget the weight loss, eat well, take your vitamins and get lots of sleep! the better you take care of your self, the more radiant you will be! if you can, treat your self to a message, but that would be just the ticket!",
				"I was at decent weight a few months ago, until I got a new job where I was literally chained to my desk and was super stressed. Now I gained back the 10lbs I lost, and then was let go... My wedding is only a few months away, and I am so crazy stressed, sad, and total loss of motivation... My goal was 30lbs and I am back where I started...and getting married in December..",
				"Definitely me. I still have 7 months.. but I got engaged a year ago next week.. and have only lost 15 pounds. My goal was 100 by the wedding!! Sucks.. I still have a bit to go.. but i'm not doing well at all. I don't have a lot of support to help me push through the plans. :/ Just remember that your fiance is marrying you for a reason.. and it isn't whether you are skinny or fat. You are beautiful no matter what. Don't think about the fact that you didn't lose weight - think about the fact that you are marrying your soul mate in a few days!!",
				"I'm always insecure about my weight. But I just bought my dress recently and I love it and feel beautiful in it, even at my weight now that I'm not happy with. So I know I will still feel good for the day. It's just the like, 20 years after the wedding that I'll be unhappy with my figure instead! LOL"

Ok let me just say that I have NEVER been a size 6 in a dress my whole life! Size 6 jeans yes...size 6 dress no. Mostly it's due to the fact that I have broader shoulders so where my rid cage starts is wider. So I run bigger on top and smaller on bottom. I've ALWAYS had to have alterations done on my dresses because of it. So I explained to the sales lady that I would be much more comfortable if she ordered it in an 8 instead but she insisted it would be too big if I did so I trusted her advice. When the dress came it in it fit..was a little tight but I figured I still had some time to lose a few pounds. I've lost 8 pounds since that first fitting and I was so happy going into my second fitting only to find that my dress is now just barely too small! How on earth that happened is beyond me and now I'm getting more \"wedding nightmares\" because of it!",
			"comments": [
				"Can it be let out a bit? How much is \"barely too smalll\". This may be your option. Is it a zip up back? Maybe put in a corset instead?",

The seamstress was telling me that they can just move the panel under the corset over and I should be ok, It just makes me nervous because my next fitting isn't until one more before the wedding! I have no problems having the dress let out a little bit if necessary but now I'm kicking myself for not sticking to my gut feeling and making the saleslady order the dress in an 8. Ugh! Lesson learned!",
				"I know what you mean\u2026. When I ordered my dress, they took measurements and ordered the dress without telling me what size. Even if they had told me the size, I don't think I would have doubted their decision. So, my dress came in in April, I tried on my size 4 wedding dress and I immediately told her it felt tight. Consultant, FSIL and FMIL all said \"well, it doesn't look tight.\" I don't care if it doesn't look tight, it feels tight. lol. So, the consultant says that we can let it out if necessary, which freaks me out. I wish they had ordered a size 6, so it could have been taken in, if necessary. Now, I am stressing about my weight (please mind, I am 5'8\" and weigh 128), not eating bread and pasta, and I am totally an emotional eater. Sorry, I had to vent!!! lol.",
				"Negean, the way you describe your gown, I think moving the back panel would be just fine. I know you're stressing, and it's ok. I was too. I worked to hard to make sure my dress zipped up that 6 weeks before the wedding, when I had my first fitting, it was too big! The seamstress did great work, but I made sure I ate properly and didn't gain an ounce. A week before the wedding it was still too big. I actually had to eat Chinese food the night before the wedding to make sure it fit properly. It worked because it fit like a glove. ...don't ask me now if I can get it to zip, LOL. I got comfy.",

				"I totally get where you are coming from...I came in for my first fitting and the dress fit perfectly. Then, I came in for my final fitting (after having lost about 3 pounds) and it was SO TIGHT! The lady took it in but I think a bit too far...so now I am FREAKING out that I will not be able to fit in it. It was so tight at the final fitting we could barely get the zipper up. I am down about 4 more pounds now...but UGHH! 1 more thing to worry about...lol",
				"I'm on a new diet and I'm also kinda freaking out about my dress. I love it and it fits fine, but you could still see a little pooch in my tummy area lol I think in your case, moving the modesty panel should work just fine. And I'm speaking as someone who wears corsets on a regular basis.",
				"I'm freaking out a little about my dress being tight too. On top of the bustle debacle, the band they sewed into the bust that you fasten in the back was so tight on the loosest setting I could barely breath. The new seamstress is loosing it half an inch so I can breath and the dress stays up. I'm a little self conscious of my pooch, even though I'm thin I'm actually considering wearing spanks so it holds my pooch in.. it is just accentuated because of the light fabric of the dress and I don't want it showing in pics. Crazy I know but I will also be on the tail end of my period during the wedding (oh joy). LOL",
				"That's so frustrating! Good luck with the alterations.",
				"It took 7 months for my dress to come in\u2026.It was a tad bit long so it had to be cut (tulle at the bottom). Well she \"accidentally\" took the pins out for the bustle without marking it. Never call me to have me come back in so 20 days before my wedding I go in for my \"last\" appointment and she tells me. SO now I have to drive 45 minutes back to the Bridal Boutique to get my dress. AND while I had to dress on she took a pair of scissors to the dress because she forgot a layer of the tulle\u2026 SERIOUSLY! THe anxiety of watching someone hack your dress UNEVEN at the bottom 20 days before your wedding\u2026.I hope your experience is better then mine!!!",

I am panicking too since I ordered mine before I deployed and I was exactly the measurements...well now having to eat in the DFAC everyday where there are very slim healthy choices I have gained some weight.

			"content": "If any of you have been reading my posts you know the birth control dilemma I'm in. For those of you who haven't, I'll sum it up. I'm sick of pills, went for IUD, they weren't able to place because I have such a \"tight cervix\", now seeking alernatives.My doc called today to check on me. The insertion attempt was pretty invasive so she wanted to make sure I wasn't bleeding anymore etc. We talked about another attempt at insertion.... not into that.Now... I'm planning on going June 2nd for the Nexplanon implant. Do any of you have one?? Pros, cons, insertion experience??",
			"comments": [
				"I've been on Nexplanon for almost 9 years now. My 3rd implant will come out right before my wedding next August. I have not one negative thing to say. It has worked for me from day 1. No weight gain, no hormonal outbreaks. I get my period every 4(ish) months. My body bleeds when it has to. The insertion experience is nothing. A few needles to numb the area and as long as you look the other way you don't know anything is happening. Your arm will be sore afterwards for a few days but that goes away, as does any bruising. I recommend Nexplanon to anyone and everyone I talk to. Hope you love it just as much as I do and this made you feel better! Good luck!",
				"I haven't personally used it, but I have heard nothing but good things about it. I hope everything gets sorted out for you and something finally works!",
				"One of my coworkers and I were talking about this yesterday, actually! She's had it for a few years, she loves hers. Said she had issue after issue with the pills, having to switch all the time, and when she got the Nexplanon in, she had no issues. Makes me want to consider it over the pills I have been taking for years.",
				"THANK YOU!! Finally people with something good to say. I am getting less and less nervous as I hear more good things. @Brieana- thanks for \"waking up\" my post!! Keep the comments coming!!",
				"I had the nexplanon for 2 months and i bled through the whole 2 months. Im sorry tmi, but it also hurt for me when my so and i had intercourse. The birth control ended up making me very dry even when we would play around he couldnt get me wet at all. Other than that i had no problems. I got my iud put back in but now im having problems with that as well recently. Im starting to hate birth control.",
				"I have implanon which I think is a different brand? No major problems. I'm scared to get it out though :/ lol",
				"I had implanon put in like 4 years ago, LOVED it, no period until about 4 months before it was time to take it out. i got another (nexplanon) put in in august and no problems. i was on the depo shot for about a year before i got it, and i gained seriously 50 lbs in a couple months!!! i mean theres prolly no excuse but my own fault for that, ive always heard that BC doesnt cause u to gain weight, it causes u to crave more and wanna eat more which equals weight gain, but after i quit i didnt gain anymore weight. insertion is really pretty easy, they numb the area and literally inject the little thing into your arm. its like 2 inches long, super thin and you can feel it under your skin but cant see it, plus its under your arm anyway. its sore for a couple days like someone said, just like if u got a shot or something in your arm. but no bleeding and nothing unbearable and i didnt even need ibuprofen for the pain or anything. i'd give it a try!! worst that could happen is u hate it, and get it removed. but it find it to be the best BC option for me anyway. pills, i forget to take them on time. IUD ive heard terrible stories of the insertion process being terrible, lots of cramping, and i personally know 3 people who had it and got pregnant!!, depo shot biggest side affect is weight gain. so the nexplanon it is! good luck!",
				"I had implanon and it was ridiculous. I bled almost non stop through the whole time I was on it. I was definitely alot moodier too. I wouldn't recommend it."

			"content": "So, I'm sitting here at work this morning with a horrible pain my side. It's finally dissipated, but there is a dull pain still there. I've had a kidney stone before & am really hoping that's not what I have again! I'm also wanting to avoid the doctor so I've decided to start chugging water. Have you all ever had a kidney stone before?",
			"comments": [
				"Aww I'm sorry, Lacey If it is a kidney stone, I hope it passes soon! I had one a few years ago. I thought it was a UTI because peeing was so damn painful. When I passed it, I felt like I wanted to die.",
				"I've never had one, but there's nothing dr's can give you to dull the pain while it passes?",
				"Could it be a cyst or appendix? I had horrible pain in my side last year and found out it was an ovarian cyst. Shit hurt. If you have had them before though then it definitely could be it again. I hope you feel better and am going to suggest you see a doctor. My medical degree came from one of those .50 cent machines so my prognosis is about as reliable as a sack of potatoes.",
				"Yep i have them in BOTH kidneys. At one point I had 7 in one and 8 in the other and they couldnt opperate to remove them because they didnt know what was causing them.. I drink lots of water and cranberry juice. I find cranberry apple is the best lol avoid salt as much as possible and you can try to rub them even (sounds crazy i know) Mine have swelled before to where you could see them looking at my back. Good luck and hooefully it gets better soon",
				"I've had them twice. God do they suck. I've decided going to the doctor for them is a waste unless its been several days because they always want to give me an expensive catscan and then they just prescribe those intense pain killers I won't take anyway. I'm sorry to hear you're in pain keep drinking water, or better yet get some 100 % cranberry juice, mix it with half water and chug that. It will keep you from getting a uti due to the blockage. Also keep moving the best you can, you probably already know this but they pass much faster that way.",
				"Dont avoid the doctor silly! it could be a tubular pregnancy or an ovarian cyst. for kidney stones you need to increase your vinegar intake by eating pickles every day or drinking a shot of apple cider vinegar",
				"@Madeline - Thank you! @Truffle - I'm not sure about the cyst.. but I don't think appendix. I \"researched\" (a.k.a. google!) & it said appendix pain is typically on the right side, which mine is on the left. Same side as last time I had a stone. @Brandie - Oh my goodness! Did you end up finding out the cause? @Anisea - What in the world is a tubular pregnancy?! Everyone else - if the pain persists over the morning, I will definitely go to the doctor this afternoon.",
				"They have cases where the baby attaches to the fallopian tube instead of the uterus and begins to develop in the tube, which is dangerous. For stones they have sound waves or some such cure that breaks up kidney stones inside you so they pass less painfully",
				"Definitely go to the doctor! I have had two kidney stones. With the first one, I didn't realize what it was. I actually thought I had pulled a muscle or something. I have a very high pain tolerance. I waited a day to do anything about it. It turned out that the stone was too large for me to pass and a blood infection resulted from me waiting. I was sepsis with a 104-105 degree fever and in ICU for 4 days. I ended up having to get a nephrostomy tube put in and then go back to the hospital three weeks later to have the stone blasted. Not saying this will happen, but just my own experience. Three years later I felt that very similar pain and took myself right to the ER. They determined it was a stone that was small enough to pass. I was given some pain meds and sent home. The stone passed within a day or so. Good luck! I hope you feel better soon.",
				"I've heard it's worst then labor.",
				"@Anisea - Ok, I think I'm in the clear on that one. @Renee - Yeah, I agree this pain is very similar to the one I had a couple of years back. I just don't want to be the girl who cried wolf at the doctor. @ToBeMrsM - Well it was all of the sudden pain around my ribs, definitely more towards the back of my body. I haven't noticed any blood in my urine - I'll go to the restroom here shorty. Yes, the pain is still there, very dull, but there. YES, there was lots of stabbing going on around 8:40 a.m. this morning. Oh, and it also sort of hurt when I breathed in.",
				"I've had kidney infections before and they were crippling. the pain was very localized in the middle of my back and i peed very frequently (and sometimes i thought i had to pee and didn't)",
				"Never had one, but heart they are extremely painful! Hopefully you get looked at so the pain can go away!",
				"FH used to get them pretty badly. He had to have a lithotrypsy (spelling?) and they put a stint in. It was an outpatient procedure, fortunately. I hope you feel better soon. I have heard that passing it is actually the least painful part. I hope you can pass it soon!",
				"This past June I had a kidney & bladder infection. It was AWFUL. Puking, sweating, felt like I was going to pass out, had a hard time breathing, severe pain in my back right under my ribs, and chest pain. I was also 7 months pregnant, so it made it so much worse! Went straight to the ER bc I had NO idea why I was having all these symptoms. They said they thought I also had passed a kidney stone. My boss wanted to call 911 bc he thought I was going to pass out at work. All I have to say is, you WILL know if you have a kidney infection/kidney stones.",
				"I have had a couple of kidney stones that passed. One was so bad I was vomiting from the pain. I needed so much pain medication just to stop the nausea that I was admitted into the hospital overnight (which was Christmas eve into Christmas morning; luckily my daughters were older so it didn't completely ruin Christmas for everyone). I'm sorry you are in so much pain but if it were me, I would get to the doctor before they close office for the weekend. If it's really bad and you have to go to the ER, it could take a lot longer to get you comfortable.",
				"Lacey, I had kidney stones when I was 8 months pregnant, I can say the pain doesn't come and go it's constant and it isn't something that is a dull ache unless you've managed to have it move along down the line. I wasn't able to take anything for pain. I couldn't lay, sit, stand etc without being in extreme pain. I'm also a very tough person when it comes to pain. I had endometrial ablasion on Monday came right home as most do, had gall bladder surgery on Saturday at 12:30 and was home from hospital by 5:30 that evening, up moving, taking care of my son who was 2 at the time. I would say cranberry juice is far better than water and you can also try the tablets they work too. If in fact it is kidney stones and you have had them before you might want to make sure they find out what is causing them. Best of Luck with it and hope that you feel better soon!!!!"

			"content": "I always hated my high school days..My class mates used to tease me by calling pumpkin ball and fat piggy.That is why I hated my high school.I tried a lot to reduce my weight.But I terribly failed.I am getting married soon.Some days before my would be suggested of doing a laparoscopic gastric band surgery .I am thinking of doing this surgery at Credit valley Clinic at Ontario.I don't want to look like a fat ugly beast on my wedding...Am I taking the right step?",
			"comments": [
				"Do your research I know people personally that this did not work. You have to understand the mental part of food first. If you don't follow the program and eat when you are supposed to and drink when you are supposed to it can make you sick on contact. There are other methods and its a costly one with a foreign object in your body. Not trying to be smart but have you tried weight watchers? The leaders know what they are talking about and it is designed so you can eat and drink together. Just do your research its mostly a mental game but good luck! Hope this helps",
				"Firstly don't be too harsh on yourself! I'm sure your FH thinks very highly of you, otherwise he would not have asked you to marry him :-) not matter what you look like. Anyway make sure you look into the risks of gastric band surgery behind deciding on it. I've heard of people having issues with nutrient absorption following the surgery. Also some people find the surgery doesn't help much as you can get around it by eating small amounts of food frequently and as a result not reducing your calorie intake. Perhaps speak to your doctor to see what options you have and also check that you don't have a hormone disorder or anything which is affecting your ability to lose weight. Ps - Good luck whatever you end up doing!!",
				"I agree with the above that is mentioned. Go talk to your primary doctor and see what they say first. Then talk to the clinic and see what the pros and cons are. And do lots and lots of research. I have a close friend who got this surgery hoping it would be a quick fix but instead it gave her many other challenges that was difficult to deal with, she got depressed and gained it all back. Please do research before you do anything. Good luck!",
				"First of all, your FH would not be marrying you if he didn't think you were stunning and gorgeous. Being overweight does not make you ugly, a beast or a lesser person unworthy of being treated well. I know it can be hard when people have teased you about it and the media doesn't help, but honestly, screw them. No matter what size you are, I'm sure you will look so beautiful on your wedding day. Stop thinking of yourself as a \"fat, ugly beast\" as you're not. You are a wonderful, beautiful woman. I'd recommend going to a therapist to speak to someone about these issues. Talk to a dr and specialist about the surgery only if you want to lose the weight for you, for health reasons. Otherwise your other issues will not allow it to be a real long term solution. Find out if OHIP or your insurance covers it but seriously don't do it just so you can look thinner on your wedding day as then you are letting the bullies win by giving into believing their harsh words.",
				"You are not a beast. Im sure you are gorgeous. Otherwise your FH wouldnt be so in love with you. Make sure its safe and is worth it before you do it. My sister had a procedure like this. She had the band. It worked for her for a little while then the band slipped. She was in horrible pain and through up constantly for a month. Thats how long it took for them to get her into surgery. Consider that because you dont want that to happen before your wedding. weightloss is 70% diet 30% exercise. If you eat healthy and take a walk every night youll see a big change. Good luck!",
				"I would encourage you to spend the money on a very motivating personal trainer/dietician. As someone who does competition bikini contests now I was at one point over weight and felt the same way about myself as you do then I decided to make big changes in my life. You need a life style change not a diet, diets don't work in the long term. As far as surgery is concerned, most doctors will make you lose a certain amount of weight before going into surgery so that your body is conditioned better and so that you have a better mental grasp of the eating you will need to be doing afterwards. Surgery should be your last option not your first but for some people it's what they need. Just know that it's not going to be an easy thing to go through.",
				"I know several people who have had gastric bypass, they all have issues now and have also put the weight back on. Loosing weight is not about how to do it the fastest you have to make lifestyle changes and work hard if you want to loose it and keep it off.",
				"I think your first step would be to invest in a therapist and a nutritionist. A lot of the times, elective surgeries like this won't be approved by insurance or even doctors if you aren't in the right state of mind and it sounds like you aren't. Time to dig a little deeper.",
				"I know someone who's had that surgery and it hasn't worked. She's gained weight and when she does eat it can make her feel sick. She may eat a lot less but it takes discipline to eat better and she does not. Diet and exercise is the only way to go in my books. Good luck!",
				"I know many who have had various types of lap band surgeries, successfully. I only know one, who went back to her previous weight...and she has had the surgery three times! I dunno WHY any doctor would agree to that! (I think they cut her off on her fourth request!) One thing...and this should concern any medical team...is the reasons you wish to have this. If you were talking about how you are concerned with your weight for health reasons, or you lack energy and etc...but this is a self esteem issue to appease others, from what I am reading?",
				"I've had issues with my weight for about 20 years now. Everytime I stick to a diet of lean protein and veggies with a few whole grains thrown in, I lose about 3-5 lbs a week. I cook a lot of soups and stews in the winter. Here's a good place to start. http://www.thegraciouspantry.com/clean-eating/. I lost 50 lbs in 3 months last time and I didn't give up alcohol or exercise.",
				"My mother and three of my aunt's had the lap band surgery about 4 years ago, and legit ALL of them have gained all of their weight back. It's no use getting surgery, when 80% of losing weight is tackling your mindset and way of thinking first. I agree with everyone else, speak to a nutritionist and a therapist first before you make any decisions.",
				"Losing weight is an emotional and physical journey. You need to WANT to lose weight and put in the effort. You can't be so hard on yourself first off. Start slow. Start eating right and exercising, even if it's just going for walks.... there is a nutritionist in that building by Credit Valley that you can speak to and she can help you find the right plan for you... It's not easy but you can do it. Stop being so hard on yourself!",
				"You need to change your lifestyle by eating the proper foods and portion control. Yes - the lap band surgery will be a great short term solution. But mentally you have to be prepared for the long term work to keep the weight off, or it will come back.",
				"You got engaged before you lost weight, so I believe your FH loves you just the way you are.",
				"If you consider yourself a fat ugly beast I don't recommend the surgery because that is more about self esteem, the surgery can't fix that...your FH obviously loves you the way you are, but you have to love yourself too. I thought about the surgery, and my FH and I discussed me getting it after the wedding. Friends I have talked to about it, have told me if you have any issue with food or self esteem the surgery doesn't really fix that and those issues will still be there afterwards....cut your self some slack...you are not a fat ugly beast...you are fearfully and wonderfully made!!!!!",
				"I'm sure your fiance loves you no matter what. Obviously, the issue here is that you don't love yourself (if you're calling yourself ugly) and surgery won't change how your mind views yourself. You definitely need to speak with your doctor to discuss the pros and cons for you, specifically, and to also prepare you for this life-changing decision. Generally, people who have this surgery can never eat a normal meal again and have to be very strict with taking multivitamins because that is the only way to take in what your body needs on such a small pouch for a stomach. If your wedding is soon, you will need to consider recovery time and any surgery to remove any excess skin that can get in the way of your movements after drastic weight loss. You need to stop calling yourself bad names. If someone else called you bad names (cont...)",
				"(...cont) you'd cut them out of your life. You need to cut that mindset out of your life because you're just hurting yourself by giving yourself that kind of abuse. The only \"ugly beast\" you have to tackle there is the mean part of your brain that is telling you that you are fat and ugly.",
				"Take care of your mind (self-esteem, self-confidence) first. Take some time to love yourself at least as much as others (family and FH) love you. Seek a therapist and a nutritionist for help and guidance. and do some considerable research before tackling the weight issue. But before all that, JUST BREATH!",
				"What is the band really going to do in a few months?",
				"Ok, this is a subject that I am very passionate about as I am a gastric by-pass patient...a success story at that. I had the roux-en-y procedure done back in July of 2010, and by May of 2011, I had lost 111% of my excess body weight. I hate to tell you but with your wedding date being May of this year, you probably will just have been scheduled for the surgery. This is not a \"oh I think I'll call the doc and get on the table for surgery the next day\"...this is a several months long process. Any decent bariatric program will require you to go through a myriad of testing which includes blood tests, ultrasounds of your legs to be sure you don't have any blood clots, sleep apnea testing, and psychiatric testing just to name a few!! Also it is my opinion that any program that is worth it will REQUIRE you to lose weight ahead of time as there are a number of reasons that step is very important, but the biggest reason why pre-surgery weight loss is so important is to shrink (cont)",
				"Your liver to a safe size to complete the surgery. As part of the pre-surgery weight loss regimen, you should be required to meet with a nutritionist on a regular basis and show what you have been eating and how often and duration of your exercise. I\u2019m sorry to be the realist when it comes to knowledge about the actual surgery, but at this point, you\u2019d be better off to get yourself a nutritionist and start a clean eating regimen and a good exercise program. Going this route could actually be a good spring board for you should you decide to do the surgery at a later time after your wedding. If you do decide to go forward with the surgery, you have to realize that this is a LIFESTYLE change\u2026this decision is something that you will need to commit yourself to and live it DAILY otherwise you WILL gain the weight back\u2026great example of that unfortunately is Carnie Wilson of the group Wilson Phillips. (cont)",
				"Weight loss surgery is NOT a miracle cure. In order for it to be successful, you MUST be ready to make LIFESTYLE changes. A credible program will ask you to go through a series of meetings with the physician, surgeon, nurse, dietitian, and psychiatrist prior to doing the actual procedure, to ensure that you are ready. I don't think you'll have that time to have the surgery, recover, and handle wedding planning in 4 months.",
				"I am a huge advocate for the surgery just so long as the person realizes that it is truly a lifestyle change. I hope this helps and good luck with whatever path you take. Edited to take out stupid remark...thanks SunshineJenn ;-)",
				"I know several people that have had the surgery and I can honestly say that 100% of them have lost weight, but at a risk to their health. They all look malnourished in the face. I know they eat healthy foods and the required amount, it just simply isn't enough. The procedure seems to age you. I would do it the good old-fashioned hard way: diet and exercise. MnDex, a person has to commit whether they do it via the lap band or the conventional way. Weight loss is a commitment and lifestyle change, no matter which approach you take.",
				"Agreed Jenn...I didn't mean to insinuate otherwise :-) Oh and there was nothing easy about what I went through Jenn...just saying. Please don't make the assumption that the surgery is the easy way out...there was nothing easy about it. I still did all the work and cried my eyes out every day for the first two weeks post surgery because I couldn't have anything other than my protein shakes...yes it was my decision to do this but it still wasn't an easy, miracle, cure-all procedure ;-)"

			"content": "If anyone could help me out on this, I'd very much appreciate it. So, on January 2nd, I started the Atkins diet (high protein, very low carb.) That was the last time that I had a good, healthy bowel movement. Since then, I've lost 7 pounds, but I'm in so much pain. There's a bit of relief every now and then, but I'm a big girl...I know I'm not expelling anywhere near what I'm consuming. I can't take fiber supplements because they have sugar/carbs in them. I'm afraid if I take a laxative, the results will be...messy. I can't Google this because H and I share a computer and I don't want him seeing it in the recent Google searches. So, ladies and gentlemen of WW, as embarrassing as this is, I'm asking you to please share any advice you can. What's your best advice for when you have BM problems? Thank you in advance.",
			"comments": [
				"So, these issues began when you started Atkins? Stop doing Atkins. Try a different method of losing weight. There are tons of options. Your body NEEDS carbs, not an over-abundance, but NO carbs isn't healthy, and clearly your body isn't liking it. I swear by Weight Watchers.",
				"I would talk to your doctor. It doesn't sound healthy to have so few BMs.",
				"I'm going to agree with \"get off Atkins\". Low/no carb diets like that are not good for the body. I'd also suggest talking to your doctor before you start any diets, though let's be real. \"Diets\" like that only work while you're on them. Making gradual changes to your eating habits and exercise routine works much better in the long run.",
				"I'm sure you are drinking plenty of water, so I won't waste you time suggesting that. Are you doing any cardio? Are you eating raw veggies?",
				"Yogurt (I suggest activia) always makes me poop lol",
				"I am doing cardio. I prefer cooked veggies to raw and since i'm on phase one, even veggies are limited. Has anyone ever tried laxatives or enemas that they can recommend? I'd take a day off work if i tried that, i guess, because nobody likes a smelly classroom.",
				"Kelsey, thanks for the suggestion, but I can't have dairy on phase 1",
				"Yeah, veggies are SO healthy and are like natural laxatives. Veggies should not be limited.",
				"Then I would talk to your doctor. Maybe he can suggest a healthier diet for you.",
				"Milk of molasses enema always helps me. Sounds silly but it will clean you out. Do it at work and then h won't know. I know how you feel I hate pooping and having other people know. I get stopped up all the time!",
				"I would stop with the diet. That is probably causing your problem. Losing weight like this isn't helpful and if you haven't had a BM in almost 3 weeks then that is not healthy.",
				"I am also going to agree with PPs that you need to get off Atkins - it doesn't seem to be agreeing with your body. But if I am having some problems - I try drinking a hot tea or hot coffee. You should also try upping the fiber from natural sources such as raw fruits and veggies.",
				"Jordan, that actually is a really good idea. I can wait until after school to do it because I have to stay for 30 minutes after the final bell rings anyhow. Can you explain to me how an enema works? Will it be instant? I really don't want to get off the diet since I'm seeing results on the scale.",
				"FutureMrsP, I'll definitely try the hot beverages. I'm currently not allowed to have fruit on this phase of the diet. I can have spinach. Isn't spinach supposed to make you poop? Or is it just supposed to make you strong?",
				"Chug a glass of salt water. It will flush you out. I wouldn't recommend making it a habit.",
				"I would suggest getting off Atkins. Not just for you because you're having problems, but it realt is an extremely unhealthy diet. Your body survives on carbs, that's where you get your energy from. You NEED them. Plus, Atkins is known for gaining weight back immediately once you go back to eating \"normally.\" It's immediate weight gain right after. If you need to be on a diet, go for weight watchers and instead of cutting out all carbs, go for healthy carbs ie sweet potatoes, brown rice, etc. hopefully this helps.",
				"Eat some beans, spinach, broccoli, pears etc. Anything that is high fibre. Honestly you should seriously reconsider the Atkins diet. You would probably lose more weight and keep it off with something like weight watchers. Eat normally- healthy foods and focus on portion control. With Atkins you will likely just end up giving yourself heart disease.",
				"Following...",
				"I second letitsnow. Many people who have done Atkins have had heart problems as a result of the diet. Your body is not made to process that much protein!",
				"I agree with PP that the Atkins diet isn't the best thing for you. However, it seems like you're determined to stick with it. Drink lots of water and eat dark, leafy greens.",
				"I eat mostly chicken. Sometimes I'll have red meat or fish. Honestly, I don't feel like I'm eating any more meat than I was before, just way less carbs. Should I use meat tenderizing powder to help it break down?",
				"I agree with the others you should ditch this diet, however if you are dead set on sticking with it I would increase your fruits & veggies - apples, mangos, pummelos always work for me along with the green leafy veggies others have mentioned. And go to Walmart and buy some Senokot, it is natural & works very well. If it doesn't work alone buy some stool softeners with it. Both are usually taken before bed and will work overnight, but neither should be taken more than 3 or 4 days. Good luck.",
				"Trisha-thank you. Is Senokot a pill, powder, or enema?",
				"You are consuming too much protein that your body cannot process. Drink more water. People say to eat green leafy vegetables but i find, for myself, that it makes it worse.",
				"Meat tenderizer has nothing to do with it. You're not getting any fiber, fiber is a carb and it's what your body uses to digest. If you're not going to eat the foods to help this along, try flax seed or Metamucil.",
				"My son has bm issues and uses Restorolax, it is a mild laxative. It \"massages\" the bowels to get it out.",
				"I'll have to look into whether or not I can eat flax seed. Thank you for the suggestion, Katie.",
				"You seem to be ignoring the stop the Atkins diet advice. I'm pretty sure the guy who invented it died of a heart attack. Please say what you are writing out loud and see if it makes sense....\"even veggies are extremely limited\"....what? Please get a different, healthier diet plan. Other (and probably forbidden) things that help are coffee, spinach, and prune juice. Seriously though, I had problems after a surgery once and it was so painful. I imagine it makes doing cardio more difficult. Yet another way this diet is causing unhealthiness",
				"I don't think you are really getting it, you need to get off Atkins. Doing an enema or taking a laxitive may loosen you up now but you don't want to be doing that every few days. Go for a 10 minute walk every day and go carb free for lunch. You'll lose weight.",
				"Senokot is a pill. I have a lot of stomach issues, and this has been suggested to me by several doctors and nurses. It always seems to work.",
				"Thanks, Trisha!",
				"Ever see the movie \"Zack and Miri make a porno\"?",
				"I'd do a coffee enema. You can buy an enema kit and just add your own cooled, brewed coffee.",
				"Mrs. Z, i love that movie! Don't think that hasn't crossed my mind. The only problem is that i'm too embarrassed to tell H about my problem and even if i did, he doesn't really like anal. I think I would have to find another \"shoulder to lean on,\" so to speak.",
				"Storm, would you recommend regular or decaf?",
				"Regular, and not just because that's funny. Not to get too personal, have you tried anal sex?",
				"Hi Jackie, Please be aware that if you are using any laxative for an extended period of time, it forces your bowels to rely on it in order to have a bowel movement. Some are worse than others, and senna/senokot is one of them. It sounds as if you might be on this diet for awhile, which leads me to think that you might come to rely on laxatives for relief. This can have long-term harmful effects on your body. Please go see your doctor! Before you start any diet program, you really do need to speak to a health professional to get their advice. Have you considered speaking to a registered dietitian? I agree with many on here that Atkins is a short-term solution, and as soon as you go back to your normal eating pattern, the weight often comes back on with extra. The important thing is to find a diet program that works for you, and that you can sustain for a long period of time. By long term, I mean for the rest of your life.",
				"I have IBS and when I have issues with BMs, I take Miralax. It's over the counter and you mix it into water. I suggest trying that. (Or go with a stool softener, that should help as well)",
				"@Marissa solid advice but OP doesn't want to take any advice that involves not being on the diet. Seriously a few months ago my dad had a stress issue that had him backed up.

				"Drink lots of water. Reevaluate this Atkins diet. Eat more veggies than anything else. Don't eat anything that comes in a box and/or has a commercial. Take some digestive enzymes and MagO7. Lastly, consider getting an enema and/or a colonic to help w your BM. Good luck.",
				"I would consult and Doctor before using anything and ask about Polyethylene Glycal 3350. Can be found at any drug store in Lax section My doctor recommended this for my 9 year old daughter who sometimes has a had time with BM We use the name brand RestoralLax (canada) it is an effective laxative that relieves you from occasional constipation with no bloating, no gas, no cramps. It enables your body to draw water into your colon to help unblock your colon, so your intestine works the way it is supposed to. It is tasteless and not gritty, just add a dose to water or juice.",
				"Thanks for all the advice guys. I'll have to look into all these laxatives and suggestions to make sure they're safe for my body. @Storm, I thought about anal, but H doesn't do it, so as a last resort, i might have to see if I can find someone who is willing.",

I'm not asking because OP is having probs w/BMs, but her refusal to consider getting off Atkins to relieve this issue AND the weird anal sex conversation that spun off. (I get the suggestion though) Listen, if you've had these kinds if unhealthy changes since starting this diet, then common sense would say, stop following the diet! I don't understand why you are insiatant on continuing with this diet plan that obviously does not work well for you. But anal sex and a coffee enema you will consider. Anyway, good luck with allll that. I hope you get some relief and lose the weight you want. Please try to stay healthy. Fitting into a dress is not worth risking your health.",

Honey, your husband married you knowing exactly (or nearly, I suppose) what you weigh. I haven't heard an MD recommend Atkins in YEARS. What you eat should be like this : have as many leafy, green veggies as you like. Lean proteins. Some fruit (earlier in the day is better). 30 mins of exercise a day (you can just walk). You will need carbs: don't eat the whole loaf of bread but feel free to have a crescent roll. Not having a BM in three weeks in downright dangerous. Your body does that when it's SHUTTING DOWN. This isn't normal constipation. Oh, and having someone \"as a last resort\"? Not to mention the damage to your new, shiny marriage...but can push it up higher into your body where you EXTRA don't want it. Be smart. Be safe. Call your doctor.",
				"My Dad was hospitalized after not having a BM for 3 weeks. I wouldn't wish the pain he was in on anyone. Atkins forces your body to eat it's own muscle & clog your arteries. Just quit it & eat whole foods. Try Paleo if you are dead set on a grain free diet. This seems silly, you are risking your health when there are so many other options.",

I know on the Akins there are several you can have as much as you want (good green leafy veggies). There is so much mis-information about low carb diets out there.",

I have always been big boned with wide hips though so I have always been a lil thick. I love my dress and want to wear on my wedding day. I believe it is a size 12. It might be a 14 though.

After a while it typically slows down and so you may not lose as much weight as you intend too. That being said, if it's your goal and you are really working at it then you very well may! Good luck with everything...",

I checked with my DB and they let me just exchange it to a smaller size. That was like 3-4 months after i had actually received it and taken it home. I would suggest trying to exhange it to a smaller size and worse thing that can happen is the corset lacing is just a bit wider than normal but it would still give a nice affect.",

I ordered a 14W, which is a plus size and has a $50 surcharge, so if I size exchange (that would bring me back into non-plus sizes) I get that $50 back.

It's more complicated than just going down a size. We don't usually lose weight evenly all over our body. I would not recommend letting David's Bridal alter it. The corset should really simplify the process though."

Anyway, just wanted to warn people. Amazon has a lot of similar complaints/warnings. It's great for weight loss/toning, but proceed with caution if you had bad knees. I mildly hurt myself the first time doing the video and a lot of the Amazon reviews have much worse horror stories (surgery, etc). She goes over proper technique VERY quickly. That said, I still find it effective if I skip those certain warm ups/exercises and do something less aggravating to my knees instead.",

The Insanity program is 60 days, so it is possible for me to tone up. I guess part of my issue is that I have my bachelorette party in two weeks, a bridal boudoir session to use for my fiances wedding gift in 3 weeks and I am angry at myself for not getting my butt in shape for any of it. I had a year to lose weight. CRAZY to think where I could be by now. I am a kindergarten teacher and unfortunately I didn't push myself to workout after long days. Even with such a high paced job, I should have woken up early or done what needed to be done. It doesn't help that at one point in my life I was 210lbs and lost close to 70.

I want the Carribean. Either way, we both win Just remember that your man loves YOU and since you love HIM, well you're a teacher. If A = B and B = C, than A = C and you must love you too",

Biggest change I did was I drink water now, I really didn't before so if anything I am doing something good.

And, losing weight IS hard. I have found recently that eating a big meal at lunch, keeping dinner light, is working really well for me, and I've only got a few pounds to get under 200. A few weeks ago I was 209. A few months 214, it's not much, but it's coming off faster this past week changing WHEN I eat, so I'm hoping to get to 190 before my big day.

And Kelly, thank you! Your saying that really meant a lot to me! You are beautiful the way you are, truly. Your fiance is completely right I think you are right though, I will always see myself as heavier. I have always been very hard on myself, so the wedding makes it about a million times worse. My fiance loves me the way I am and for whatever reason he thinks my size is perfect. He has made me love myself more, which also keeps me from being as motivated as I could be, haha! I attached some photos of me when I was larger. Most people think I'm kidding when I say I lost a lot of weight. I got down to a size 3, but that was doing 2 a day workouts and training with a trainer. I have accepted the fact that may not be a realistic goal now that I have a full time career and a much busier schedule.",

But I also know very well that feeling of \"it doesn't matter what YOU think, just what *I* think/feel/see\". I do think there is still plenty of time for you to make visible changes for yourself (taking progress pictures helps - you might be surprised how far you come in a month or two without even realizing it). That said, don't stress about it. Say the scale doesn't budge even with work - oh well! You are beautiful, your man knows you are beautiful, and I don't think you'll regret your wedding photos either way. They'll bring back too many happy memories of a wonderful day!",

It looks like we are getting married right around the same time. Yay for October weddings! I am so jealous you are going to Hawaii! It is gorgeous and you will LOVE it! Keep up the hard work, you are going to look amazing! P.S - I wish you were right about my dress. I got a tighter fitting one with the idea I would lose weight and it would motivate me more. I also ordered my regular size as opposed to a size up (big mistake, lol). It is fitted about to the high hip area, but my tummy area could be a problem if I don't tone it up!",

We are cruel to ourselves, it really is sad I think I will always associate myself as a big girl. Even at my smallest I still felt huge!",
				"Thank you, Sabrina. It's so, so hard to train ourselves out of that mindset. The last time I was this size, I also still felt huge. It was what lead to me gaining a lot of weight, in part. I said forget it! I feel big anyway, I may as well just eat what I want and enjoy myself. 6 years later, my weight was much higher than it had ever been. I had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and a LIVER DISEASE resulting from the weight I was carrying. I was only 22 when I got that news. I'm 23 now and have things back under control, mostly because it wasn't optional. I didn't want to end up needing a liver transplant if I had a choice in the matter. I still have to be careful and vigilant about my liver, but the blessing has been this - it helps me put aside the self-abusive thought patterns I have about my appearance and focus on just being healthy. So I do still feel big even though I'm not.. but I know I'm doing better health wise! So I say go ahead and give it your (more)",
				"..best effort to tone yourself or lose weight. Even if you can't see an immediate difference in 6-8 weeks, it's probably still there. And you might feel good about just doing the work for work's sake. But still, don't stress on it. <3 Enjoy your wedding!",
				"Looking at the health aspect of it is a great idea! I really should focus on that in the long run. Nothing is more important than health. I am so happy that you have made so many positive changes, good for you love!",
				"Sabrina, When I was younger... like high school, and I was maybe 130 (I'm 5'9) I thought I was heavy... as I got older, the weight eventually crept on and I didn't see coming or even realize it was there. I felt fine. I was confident. I had no problem attracting the opposite sex. Then I started taking these diet pills and weight started falling off of me. I got down to 145. It wasn't until I got down to 145 did I become self conscious of myself. The years go by, the weight came back... now after the engagement it's more than before. My FH is a smaller guy. Only about an inch shorter, but smaller framed. His whole family are smaller people and constantly take jabs at people about their weight. They have yet to jab me to my face. My point is, everyone has their issues. It's up to us to do something about it. I think even if you just got an hour walk in a day, you would feel better because you were doing SOMETHING about it. Trust me, you WILL be beautiful!",
				"Oh and BTW your pics you put up are ADORABALLS!!!!",
				"Sabrina, you look great! I just went through your e-photos. Instead of focusing on how you haven't lost any weight in a while, focus on all that weight you already did lose! That's an amazing thing you did. Also, I love your proposal story! I got engaged in the Magic Kingdom too!",
				"Umm I set out to lose. I gained about 20 and barely fit in my dress I feel like I look huge in my pics but still feel I look beautiful because I never dress up or do my hair. Honestly the pics lately look like me. Lol. So yes I understand. A very strict low carb diet you could lose a bit before the wedding believe it or not. Low carb, high protein and the gym would be good too. I know that's hard with no motivation because I'm still in that boat, I'm gaining more And more and just too mopey to want to fix it lol.",
				"Thank you so much, Kelly! You are awesome!",
				"Abby, you are right! I should try to switch my focus. Thank you for your suggestion. Sometimes it is just easier said than done",
				"P.S - Kelly, you are in Bradenton?! I just moved from there!",
				"Sabrina, looking at your pics you are adorable! You will be smiling so much on your wedding day and will feel beautiful in your dress!",
				"Sabrina loosing weight isn't a walk in the park. I've been telling myself that I was going to put myself on a strict diet a year from the date of my wedding (Yeah right). You are such a doll & I'm sure there are plenty of other things that you can be worry yourself about. It's never to late to start bc ur not dieting ur changing your way of eating. But what's most important is that the man of ur dreams which will be ur husband loves u no matter what. You will be a beautiful bride whether u remain the same or lose the 20 pounds, don't beat yourself up..",
				"You can't lose 20 lbs in that time, but you can start healthier habits. even if you don't lose ANY weight, if you start working out now you could be noticeably more toned by then. I have only lost about 8 lbs in the last year and a half of working out ( I need to be better about my diet), but I still look like I lost more than that because I'm much more muscular and toned than I was, and I feel much better because I've been trying to eat better and working out.",
				"Me to i am 9 months out but have lost about 10 pounds but still i have been trying . a good way to help lose sone weight drink just water no sodas breads and fast food and that should help lose those last few day's",
				"Thanks Sabrina, in the 3 months I've been working out I've lost 6lbs out. I haven't really lost anymore but I can see the muscles I've gained and toned out in my arms so it keeps me feeling good about myself. I'm 5'11 and I hide the extra weight (mostly in my tummy) my goal is to loose 40 pounds but I'll be completely happy with 20 before the wedding next year!"

If you follow me on here you know I just bought a house so I have been stress eating and the weight has been showing! My wedding is in 3 months ahhh!!! First fitting is next Tuesday 3/26. I know I can't lose much by then. So my question is, I would like to lose at least 15-20 lbs which would bring me down a size my the next fitting which I guess is a few weeks before the wedding. Will the seamstress be able to pull my dress in at that fitting? Or am I too late and can't lose much weight because she won't be able to pull the dress in with such short time? Have any of you lost a lot of weight right before your final fitting? What did the seamstress do? HELP!",

				"Perhaps you could ask to put your first fitting off by a little bit? Increase your intake of water, Omega 3, and green tea. Decrease intake of dairy and carbs (especially complex ones). Try to eat 5-6 meals a day to boost your metabolism. I'm getting measured for my dress on Friday, so I won't be eating any complex carbs or cheese between now and then. Carbs make you retain a lot more water and dairy like cheese has a lot of calories in it (which sucks because I LOVE cheese and didn't realise it was THAT bad!). You could also look into carb detoxes? I did an amended version of one (i.e. still ate some good carbs) and lost some weight relatively easy. I have been able to keep it off because it wasn't anything too drastic. I don't believe in eliminating entire food groups from diets, because you will just yo-yo. My plan is to lose around 15lbs before the wedding. I started my healthy eating plan and a little bit of exercise about a month ago and I have lost nearly 8lbs so far",
				"Here's the thing, I am having a lot of work done to my dress from the start. So I need her to get that started.",
				"Bump!",
				"Oh fun! recently I have lost 60lbs. yay! and I am in the nursing field with a great friend who is a nutritionalist. First if you are a stress eater, you need to do something to destress you. I started yoga and low and behold I stopped my stress eating and toned up. Next cut sugar and carbs to the minimum. I don't count calories but I do however watch the sugar and carbs because not only do they make u gain actual fat but also make you retain water. It is amazing what an extra dose of calcium, b12, biotin, and a standard multi vitamin can do for your overall health. I am anal about this. And my least favorite. protein. Lean meats are your friend and I drink protein shakes. gross. Then again I changed my entire habits around. Hope this helps at all! good luck!",
				"I think it is recommended that you only lose two pounds a week to keep healthy. I lost about 20 pounds two years ago just doing calorie counting with my fitness pal, eating less processed foods (not totally cutting them out), portion control, and working out daily for at least 30 minutes. I didn't cut out alcohol or stop eating everything (although I tend to eat healthily anyway)",
				"A low carb diet would be the fastest way to lose the amount you want in a short amount of time but you would have to be strict with it. By the 3rd day you body goes into ketosis which means instead of burning carbs it will start burning fat (which is a good thing) for energy. Leave all that low fat mess alone b/c it increases sugars &/or salts in foods. Enjoy 100% full fat cheeses in moderation. Keep your sodium down to 1500 mg, 10-12 cups of water, keep carbs at 20g for 2 wks then 25g for 1 week, then 30g gradually increasing carbs increments of 5g til the 5th wk then increas by 10g & stay with 50 to 80g per day. The idea is to eat a high protein, high fat & low carb diet. Check out www.yourlighterside.com for recipe inspiration or google low carb recipe's.",
				"I would just talk to your seamstress and ask them how long it would take to alter the dress if you lose 20 pounds. Does your dress have a corset? My second (supposed to be final) fitting is tomorrow. I want to lose about five more pounds, but right now my dress is pulled as tight as it will go. I'm thinking about having her take it in a little bit. If I don't lose the weight, no big deal I'll just have a little more gap in the corset back. If I do lose the weight, I'll just pull it tighter!",
				"I've had the best success with Weight Watchers, I've been doing it for over a year now and have been losing about 5 lbs a month (when I am good and follow the plan exactly). Some people lose as much as 3 lbs a week, but that is not very common. I would say try WW, but have realistic expectations. Good luck, just remember, your wedding day is not about you looking a certain way, it's about you being happy and marrying the person of your dreams.",

				"I used to do a lot of costuming and we had to prepare for things like this all the time. you want to be a size smaller at the actual wedding, do you mean a size smaller than you are now without wearing something like a corset or a spanks? if yes, I would just get something like a spanks to help pull things in a bit and smooth things out. often it's not about being a size smaller, but presentation. if it's really just a case of one dress size, I would just work on knowing how to pose for pictures, keeping your posture and having the secret weapon of a good spanks. I come from a family of photographers and worked in photo labs for years\u2062 was the brides that took ate right, exercised vs dieting that were the most radiant. you could tell the one that worked to loose that last 15 pounds in the end. do you yoga? you may not loose 10 pounds by the wedding, but it can reduce stress,(less stress eating) gain strength&possibly loose a few pounds as a bonus.",

So i'm torn... lose weight and pay extra to get alterations or stay the way i am and practice photo poses for non double chin!??

We usually mix them with DreamFields Pasta so we can have more but not up the calorie//carb content. They are not something you can just sprinkle cheese on and eat. In order to enjoy them to their fullest, they need to be mixed with something very moist and flavorful, and they need time to absorb the flavor. It's not a quick absorption. Good luck and best wishes!",

I tried my first pack today and mixed them with a spoonful of spicy Thai peanut sauce, then microwaved. They had pretty good flavor absorption but I had to re-drain because they got watery sitting in the bowl. They definitely filled me up and I had no belly complaints. I look forward to experimenting.... Next time I'll try rinsing like others said, definitely drain longer, and maybe skillet-cook or let them sit in whatever flavor/sauce longer?

				"Yeah i know. It just sucks when he's eating donuts, chips and cookies and the next morning he's lost five lbs.lol I'm eating the calories calculated by the program. Around 1500 or so. I might do my p90x after this since that one uses weights plus I'm getting sick of jumping everywhere.",

				"Men have more muscle than women, so losing weight comes very easy for them. The fact that you have lost 2\" from your waist is amazing! Don't let that discourage you. You may not be losing weight, but your body is responding in it's own way. Personally, the Insanity! workout was too much jumping for me.",
				"I hate the jumping. I have really high arches and have bought 3 pairs of workout shoes and it still doesn't help. I just like it because the workouts are shorter and you don't need any equipment.",
				"I know how you feel hon! FH and I are eating better and exercising and he has lost almost 15lbs and I have only lost 7! I can get very discouraging, but keep at it and don't lose hope!",
				"That's why I don't like it. After one session my arches felt as though they had collapsed.",
				"This happened to me too! My fiance and I did it for a month together, I only lost a few pounds but tons of inches off my waist and legs! He lost like 20 pounds that month! (We also were eating very healthy too!) Just keep at it it is working and your body will look amazing after",
				"I've been seeing awesome results from the Insanity program!! I'm holding off as long as I can to buy my dress because I keep losing inches and weight. ( No complaints from me!) I did get discouraged at first when my fiance saw results much more quickly than me but if you just keep with it you'll have fantastic results as well! I signed up for the pre-order of the Insanity Asylum volume 2 (http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/insanity-the-asylum-volume-2-elite-training-workout.do) - set to come out this fall - to increase the intensity of my workouts. Hopefully I see even more results from that too. When I start to lose motivation I just think about how bad I want to have a rockin' body in my fabulous wedding dress!! Keep with it Tynisha!!",
				"Omg I totally feel you. First, DO NOT look at the scale. F the scale, you are obviously gaining muscle and if you are losing inches that's all that matters. My FH goes swimming and will come home with Wendy's and looks better after a week! I eat salads and dumb lean cuisines and do cardio like mad and it takes me about a month to lose a month so I totally feel your pain. Men just drop quicker...",
				"Ugh, that's so annoying. H once lost 5 pounds after 2 weeks of eating Cheetos in his lunch, rather than Doritos. That is seriously the only thing he changed. Love him but ugh. In other news, 2 inches around your waist is amazing! That's more than one entire dress size! Keep up the good work, you might just be retaining water or your muscles might be swollen from the workouts, that could contribute to the gain on the scale. Are you following the nutrition program as far as eating ENOUGH?"

				"That is the great thing about Weight Watchers, you can buy their frozen meals (at the grocery store they aren't like a Jenny Craig center), or just cook & eat whatever you want. They promote healthy eating, like getting in enough veggies & fruits for the day, water, dairy, etc. Based on your weight, gender, etc you get a certain number of points per day you can eat & then 49 weekly points to splurge on stuff, all foods have a points value. It is super easy to figure out since they have a point calculator app for my phone. @Jen - I find that what helps out the most is tracking what I eat. You can track online, through an app or I do it with a little handwritten book so I can keep it on my desk at work. I write down everything I eat & track my points so I don't go over for the day. The hardest part? EXERCISING!!! I have to step up my game, without the exercise I find that I am FLABBY! LOL. And I don't want to just weight less, but look good in my dress & bathing suit too!!!",

I've heard a lot of people talk about the \"fruit and veggie\" diet and was wondering if anyone has tried it and what they think of it? I plan on pairing this with walking/jogging 3 miles a day, which I lost about 30 lbs in 3 months one summer. Thanks for the input ladies! Edit: Well, I probably should\u2019ve mentioned that I don\u2019t plan on staying on the diet very long\u2026 My Bad! LOL. Anywho, the plan is to eat fruits and veggies for 2 weeks, just to get my body going, then add in protein/grains. (Egg on wheat toast for breakfast, small bits of chicken in my salad, and the like). I also have been taking supplements for the past several months so I am still getting my daily dose of what my body needs. What I\u2019m wondering is has anyone done something similar to this and what your results were. Thanks!",

I have tried it and while I don't have much weight to lose I did lose the \"bloat\" very fast just eating raw foods/going on the elliptical for 30 mins. each day, and juicing. I felt AWESOME just eating those kinds of foods, had much more energy, and just overall looked better. But then the FH made me eat some pizza (ok I ate it on my own) and it's hard getting back into that \"diet\". But YES do it!",
				"I strongly advise against any diet that cuts out food groups. While fruits and veggies may sound healthy, it''s not a good diet plan by itself. 1st, if you are planning on working out too, your body is going to need protein to build muscle, where is your body going to get this from if you're only eating fruits and veggies? 2nd, have you ever thought about what fruit is? It's water, some fiber and sugar. All fruits have sugar, yes they have really good properties too, like some are higher in fiber, antioxidents, etc. Veggies have a lot of vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidents too, but putting yourself on veggies and fruits is basically a sugar and fiber diet. The best way to loose weight is to eat a little bit from each food group, in moderation 4-5 times a day to keep your metabolism moving. Eat 1100 -1300 calories per day, stay away from fried foods, and get your carbs from whole grain. Drinking eight 8oz glasses of ICE water can burn an extra 100 calories per day too.",
				"I agree with Jennifer, especially since you plan on exercising. You need to give your body the proper fuel, and you need protein. If you really want to lose weight, cut out processed sugars, sodas, and juice drinks. All that extra sugar is not necessary. When you juice a piece of fruit, you are getting rid of the fiber, which you need for your digestion, etc.",
				"I did this and it felt great. It's not something you can do long term. I ate only fruits, veggies, and nuts for a week and used protein powder to ensure I was getting the right amounts of everything your body needs. Then the following week I added chicken breast and eggs. It's just really expensive and so I really couldn't keep up.",
				"I also agree with Jennifer. I actually talked to my doctor about a similar thing just today. He adviced me to have some sort of protein with every meal. I eat TONS of fresh fruits and veggies, but I encorporate a lot of eggs and thin sliced meat, as well. The only thing I'm really probably lacking on is grains. I need to work on that.",
				"Wow, I could never do that. I'm a carnivore. I would recommend you get some sort of protein in your diet.",
				"I actually went to the weightloss doctor today and he put me on a diet that is like Atkins and some other one. He said NO fruit because fruit turns to sugar. You can have a small amount of blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries every now and then with lite cool whip but no other fruit. And absolutely NO white foods. pasta (unless wheat or veggie) no milk unless lactose free (almond milk) no sugar no white rice. etc. He said you don't count calories you count carbs. No more than 50 carbs a day. I am going to start this tomorrow so we will see how good it works. He did say you can eat as much lean meat as you want. Just NO bacon.",
				"Couldnt agree more with Jennifer K.",
				"I agree with the other posters who think this isn't a great plan for your overall health and well-being. I've been doing weight watchers and have been losing about 1lb per week for the past 2 months (only 8lbs total), but guess what? That 8lbs is NEVER coming back and I will look and feel amazing on my wedding day and for the rest of my life because I'm making an entire lifestyle change. It's not just about shedding pounds quickly, it's about making yourself healthy forever. Sorry, didn't mean to get all soapboxy, but I just think you deserve better than starvation.",
				"Rae, that's actually a beautiful way to put it :-) Otherwise, ladies are right.",
				"I agree with Jennifer & the others. I would also add that your muscles require calcium to function. Heard of rigormortis? It is when a body's muscle is no longer receiving calcium, which is required for muscles to STOP contracting. If you don't ingest calcium, guess where your body gets it from? Yup, your bones. Similar with protein. If you aren't ingesting any your body will take it from your muscles If your exercising, just limit your caloric intake, and eat healthy, balanced meals. Have healthy snacks, save a few calories for a treat, so you don't have the urge to binge. =)",
				"Eat a balanced diet. Make a lifestyle change. I hate all these fads! If you must, try this instead: get a normal size dinner plate fill an eight with meat, an eight with grain and then the rest with veggies and eat fruit as desert/ snacks 2-3 times a day. This way you still get your protein and carbs but you kinda get on that diet. I can attest that eating MORE fruits and veggies WILL help you lose weight, but it is NOT healthy to eat ONLY fruits and veggies. I don't care what vegans say, there are certain things your body NEEDS to function properly. I live in Taiwan and a lot of the older ladies tell me : stop eating meat and you will lose sooo much weight. I telll them well I still need protein so I will not stop. But I have cut back from the amount I used to eat when I lived back home.",
				"I did a fruit and veggie diet on a few different religious occasions and I did slim down a lot, but you have to gradually reintroduce meat back into your diet or you'll hurt yourself. Also it should only be temporary because you are depriving yourself of whole grains, protein and dairy. Sometimes adding beans or nuts to sub for meat is good. Rice is good for grain. You can also drink low fat milk and eat yogurt. Overall, eating balanced meals and burning more calories than you eat is the best solution.",

Enduce early so that you don't have it at the wrong time. \"Generally Parsley tea is considered to be the most effective as a mild emmenagogue as it relaxes the cervix to allow release of menstrual material. Fresh herbs are best \u2013 water should be placed into a pan and allowed to boil, and then bring the water down to a simmer adding a handful or two of chopped parsley, allow to steep for approximately half an hour. The tea is then strained and honey can be added for a better taste. If using fresh herbs seems too much of a fuss parsley tea bags are readily available, however it should be made with warm, not boiling water as boiling water will result in the parsley loosing some of it\u2019s potency - although if using dried herbs it is important to get as fresh as possible. Tea should be drunk four times a day, and will usually induce a period quite fast.\"",

				"I take BC straight (i never take the inactive pills) so dont pay more money for the ones that claim they are special for only having your period once every 4mo, all BC can do that. the ones that DO NOT HAVE TRI LEVELS OF HORMONES have a less of a chance of spotting.",

				"If you talk to your doctor they have things to give you to stop it. The doctor may put u on a low dose birth control maybe a month or two before your big date that way you have more control of when it will start or finish.",
				"Strange suggestion but I know from my experience that spermicide tends to throw off my periods by at least two weeks but you have to be extremely careful because the chemical that actually kills the sperm can lower your immune system down there. That isn't always the case apparently it depends on the person but, I just thought I would through that out there",

I just go straight through the active pills and on to the next pack. Now I spot only when I forget to take the pills for a few days (I forgot for 3 days straight and started spotting). I plan to go off right after the wedding. I don't like pumping my body with hormones and I'm not concerned with pregnancy prevention anyway. Definitely talk to your doctor ASAP. 7 months should be more than enough time to get your period to stop, but if you have an adverse reaction to the hormones (my sister bled for 2 months straight while on the pill), you'll want the extra time to correct it.",

			"content": "So a few weeks ago I went wedding dress shopping and I finally found my dress. Now I went to 2 different boutiques and both had the same dress I wanted. one store had the dress in a size 18 which I was able to step into the other store and the dress in a 16, but the only way I could get it on is if I put on over my head. Now when ordering the dress I noticed that I ordered the 16 because I\u2019ve been trying to lose weight for my wedding (so far I\u2019ve lost 22 lbs) and according the Boutique\u2019s measurement sizes an 18 would be a too big(& would cost extra) but the 16 was a lil small. I am 4 inches bigger in the hips, waist & chest for the 16. But I know I\u2019m going to lose this weight. Well anyways I telling one of my friends that I ordered the dress in the 16 since I was able to put it on, but over my head and the sales girl told me Maggie dresses don't really stretch by much (only about 1/2 and inch) So I figure I would be ok. Well my friend is telling me I made a huge mistake and i",
			"comments": [
				"Should not have ordered the dress in and 16. I'm wondering if I Made a huge mistake in ordering the dress in a 16. Has anyone wearing a Maggie dress for thier wedding that can tell me if the 1/2 an inch strech is true?",
				"I had a maggie. It was a corset though. I ordered a 16 because I was between 16 and 18, and with the corset it fit perfect.",
				"I don't know about Maggie dress but I think it was a mistake to order the dress smaller than what you can wear, most of the time is easier to have it taken in than having it let out.",
				"I don't know about Maggie's either, but I agree with Tach. Always err on the side of bigger because it is far easier to take it in that to let it out. I hope it works out for you.",
				"Maggie dresses are usually adjustable because of the corset. I think you should be okay, but I agree with the others - I would have ordered a larger size. But I think you might be okay.",
				"This is more motivation to lose weight! Good luck. I'm sure it will work out. You have plenty of time!",
				"I ordered a maggie, and i bought a size 18, the 16 was a little snug but they didn't charge me extra for it! Which maggie dress did you get?",
				"I got the Adore. I got the 16 beacuse they were going to chage me extra for the 18...but I know I can lose the weight...and it is a Corset Back.",
				"It is much easier to alter with a larger size. Was the 16 you tried on comfortable, you just needed to bring it down over the hips? Remember the sample dresses are typically stretched out a bit from all the people trying it on. Could you tie up the 16? If you get close on your weight the seamstress can probably take it out about 1/2 an inch but you will not have much play room.",
				"I find Maggie's are very true to size. Where as a lot of dress companies make wedding dresses that are size 14 for an actual size 8, Maggie makes a 14 for a 14. It really depends on the type of skirt. My hips were a bit bigger for my size, but because of the cut of the dress, it fits fine.",
				"It just depends on how much weight you are going to lose and how commited you are. I tried on a size 10 (Alfred Angelo) which fit me pretty well, but ordered an 8 because I knew I wanted to lose weight. I lost 13 pounds between when I ordered the dress and when it came in, the 8 is too big and I had planned on trying to lose another 10lbs atleast, so in hindsight I probably should have ordered a 6. However, different designers fit their dresses differently. I would say that a good rule would be every 10-15 pounds is going to be a full dress size, so if you can lose that much you should be fine.",
				"The good thing is that corset is usually more forgiving than a zipper. Also, you have 6 months left, so you should be able to lose enough weight to fit into a 16.",
				"know what you mean. I am a little concerned myself. I bout an Oleg Cassini from DB all the dresses I was trying on were either an 8 or a 10 but the one I chose CWG352 was a 14. The sales girl said I was a perfect size 10 and that's what we ordered. After it came in we reailzed she didn't measure me and probably should have but because all the 8 and 10's were fitting she just ordered the 10. It's fits me perfectly but if I gain even 5lbs. it will be to small and in order for it to fit we had to remove the corsette bra underneath and just use cups. So I'm concerned bc my wedding is 13 months away and I'm wondering if I should exchange it for a 12 but if I do that than I'm running the risk of it being to big and having to spend money to alter it as of now no alteration are needed. I honestly think with a corsette you will be fine.",
				"I think it should be ok, sjust keep up the exercise and good eating and work off the little bit thats left... if it was 2 sizes to small i would say it was a big mistake, but this is not that bad.",
				"You should be fine, but putting extra stress on yourself to loose weight isnt good, although you do have time. Planning a wedding is stressful. My dress fit like a glove from the moment I bought it. The only alterations that needed to be done was a hem and a bustle so after I bought my dress I did not want to gain or loose weight, but I ended up gaining weight because of the stress! It was terrible, the morning of the wedding as we were getting ready, my sister (my MOH) was getting ready to zip me up and she almost couldnt! It was funny, she was like suck it in because I cant zip this. I was like thats not even funny and she was like I am serious! So be careful! Luckily it all worked out, I dont know what I would have done if she couldnt zip it!",

				"Thanks Everyone for thier feedback and advice. The sample size I tried on Fit perfectly...I normally am a size 16 and I have been watching my eating and working out hard. The difference between the 18 & 16 was when trying on the 18 I was able to step into the dress, but with the 16 i had to put it on over my head. It was a lil sung on the hips, but it fit overall. Here is pic of me in the dress(size 16).",
				"Looks awesome!!",
				"It looks good on you. You still have plenty of time to drop a little more weight (if that is what you want to do). Just don't stress out about it too much.",
				"You look amazing! Yeah you have time and if you stick to your diet you should be OK'",
				"I was a 16 but ordered my Maggie Sottero in a 14. I'll admit, come the wedding day, even though I had lost weight and fit the dress, I still had a little upper back fat/skin that I wouldn't have had it if I would have gotten the 16, but the 16 would have been a touch too big. So it worked out. And the corset is actually very forgiving, but I still had a little skin in the back that I hated. I should have worked out my upper back before the wedding!!",

			"content": "My fiance & I are getting married in 10 months, which seems like a long time but considering we're both students who work two jobs a piece & are not exactly near our ideal weights... it seems like just a few days away. Last month I fractured & bruised the bone in my right foot in three separate places & the doctors say it could take anywhere from weeks to months to heal. It's been 6 weeks and my foot is still visibly swollen & bruised & I'm becoming frustrated that I'm unable to get in shape like I'd planned.Is there anyone that may have had a similar experience & knows of some exercises I could do to help get the extra pounds off without moving my foot? Any feedback would be GREATLY appreciated!!",
			"comments": [
				"I've not had a similar experience, but I def know that boxing, even when sitting can really get your heart rate up..like on biggest loser once they had a guy just sit and do punches since he had knee problems..I'm not sure of any specifics beyond that tho..I'm sure there are gym staff or physical therapists that can give you more specific tips :-)",
				"I have no idea - but would definitely talk to a doctor first before trying anything.",
				"Check with your doc first just to make sure. You might be able to do some swimming (But no kicking obviously) Also pilates can really get your heart rate up just be careful that there is not too much movement with the fot. Best thing though is check with your doc to find out what movement and how much is OK for your foot right now. I have had many injuries and was really bad and kept riding. I rode a whole summer with a cast on which was a big no no. Don't be a bad patient like me though! On second thought I can think of some great cardio you and your Fh can do together that should be ok for your foot! I would do some water therapy on it to get the swelling down. Hold your foot under streaming water with a low pulse (like a shower head) to help with swelling. The pulse will help with the circulation too for healing and again swelling.",
				"I had a problem with my foot once - where the doctor told me to keep off my foot - (not being able to do my daily walks) - just thinking here - can you possible do weights on machines - where you're not using your foot - but doing sit down weights (the machines were you sit - and work on your upper body) - stomach / arms and so on",
				"Jillian Michaels says punches.",
				"I dont know why my comment was spaced like that. Tried to edit it to fix but the space wasnt showing. oh well!",
				"Cast lifts? LOL, that was only partially tongue in cheek. If your doc says okay, leg lifts might help.",
				"I'm currently taking Pilates with a personal trainer. It is not a cardio workout in any sense. It's more strength training. You can change the pace to make it cardio like but that would open you up to injuries. Talk to your doctor.",
				"I've fractured my left ankle before, and I used to dance in place (btw~my entire left leg was stationary when I did this and I don't think my injury was as bad as yours sounds) to try and get some cardio done. I'm not sure if it did anything because it mainly involved me just wiggling my butt around but it felt better than just sitting around. Actually, one serious exercise move you could consider is the one where you are on your back, your knees are bent, your arms are by your side with your palms flat on the ground, and you do tiny crunches while you pump your arms up a little bit each time. We used to do those in swim and they were KILLER. Be careful about your leg though~best advice is to check with your doctor~as I do not know the extent of your injury and how this move might affect it.",
				"On the same line with all of the other posts, I would definitely ask a doctor or a physical therapist. Also going to a gym that has personal trainers - they will be able to tell you what exercises you can and can't do with certain body parts that are hurt. I was thinking about swimming and there are floaty things you can put in between your thighs to keep your legs afloat and just use your arms to swim - this will definitely get your heart rate up the best I'd say. But be careful, move your foot and kick a little- it HURTS! (and I only had a sprain!) Also, there are chair exercise videos that you could buy. I used to do them with clients that had physical disabilities. I really think it's great that you are trying to keep up with your exercising even though you are injured. But another suggestion, if you are not able to be as active as you typically are, I would definitely lower your caloric intake. Good luck! Let us know what you end up trying out and what works for you!",
				"Weights burn twice the fat. So along with the punching and etc everyone else mentioned. Arm weights and leg weights can be your friend. And at my gym they have a physical therapist who tells you the exercises for your injuries. Maybe check into that . Good luck",
				"You're wrong Natalie. Weights do not burn twice the fat. Weights are used for strength training to build muscle (which will counts towards muscle weight). During strength training you burn less calories, and the additional calories you burn due to the gain in muscle in your body is barely enough to make a difference, your time would be much better spend doing cardio where you would burn more calories during the workout (and less after). For example, if you run for 40 minutes (medium aerobic level @ 8 min miles) that is about 500 calories during the workout, 30 calories from the afterburn, and 0 calories burned by muscle. For 40 minutes of strength training you burn about 140 calories, 20 calories burned from the afterburn, and 30 calories burned by the muscles. Cardio wins.",
				"Actually Glenda told me Muscle burns fat Miya. It increases your RMR and AMR.For example THIS idiots means to say that more muscle will burn more fat at rest and while you are working out. Best approach is a combo of both. Bigger muscles allow you to burn more while doing the cardio. But that wasn't exactly her question. It was about what can she do with her foot being injured. Also if your heart rate is not elevating to get cardio benifits your trainer is not having you do them correctly! Some of the movements are HARD if sone correctly.",
				"Sex is something you can do while laying down!",
				"It really does work like a charm",
				"You mean BMR? You're correct though that it should be a mix of cardio and weight training. Those go hand in hand. When one does cardio you also lose some muscle which is why weights are needed. I also wasn't replying to the OP, I was directly addressing Natalie. I already shared my advice to the OP by telling her to talk to her doctor.",
				"I like recreational workouts like that. Ohhhh yea!",
				"No I mean RMR. However they can be pretty much interchangeable",
				"Wow that really sucks, & believe me, i understand. I was in a car accident on Sept. 1, 2009, &I broke three bones in the top of my right foot. It took months to heal,& at the time I had JUST gotten on a new BC, so that did not help at all. In trying to lose wieght, when I could not get around well, it was so awful. i had never broken a bone before in my either. So much pain. I really feel for you. as much as you might hate it, I did, use crutches. I begged sometimes for one those litle scooter things or a wheel chair, such a big baby I was, but I had to use cructhes,& I was a busy person so i was having to get around on them ALOT. Did not help as much as I would have liked but I am sure I would have gained twice as much had I gotten a wheel chair or something. Also, even though it took about three or four months or so to start getting around,& walking normal again, I still have problems w/ my foot. It still hurts sometimes,& I used to wear heels,&I don't like them anymore.",
				"RMR = Resting Metabolic Rate. BMR = Basal Metabolic Rate. I assumed you meant BMR instead of AMR.",
				"Basically, I know yours is not broken, and you will probably heal sooner than I did, the moral to that story is move around as much as you can, don't just sit idle alot cause it hurts to or something. AND of course do as the dr. orders.",
				"Nope. Active Metabolic rate= AMR - Your muscles will burn more as you do cardio if your muscles are stronger. RMR or you can say BMR=building muscles will allow you to burn more while at rest. Both measures when the body is at rest. http://preventdisease.com/healthtools/articles/bmr.shtml Check out that website for further Questions.",
				"I had a foot injury that included fractures, torn ligaments, etc. Swimming is the best exercise you can do. I'd strongly recommend NO KICKING! Just dragging the lower half of your body will actually build your upper body strength. Once it begins healing much better, try water running. I'd do light weights for your arms, and which will build your muscle, which burns fat quicker. Sit-ups, and leg lifts and also great. Chick push-ups (on your knees) would be a good exercise as well. What concerns me is you aren't in any type of device to help you heal! Foot fractures take forever to heal! Mine took almost 2 years! See if you can get an airsoft cast. I assume you were in a boot or soemthing for 6-8 weeks... I know it's been a while, but you should still be in something! There really isn't alot of cardio stuff you can do just yet, without access to a physical therapists office.",
				"Ah I see. Well, that's a given if your muscles are stronger you can go longer and burn more calories during cardio. But relying and saying weights will burn twice the fat than cardio is incorrect.",
				"Swimming maybe?! I don't know if you are in a cast or not I didn't read all posts.",
				"Definitely speak to your doctor first, but here's a couple of ideas: If you have access to a gym with an upper body ergometer (hand bike), you could do that. You could also use a rowing machine. Both are upper body cardio. Also, read this: http://www.livestrong.com/article/462802-exercise-routines-for-a-broken-foot/",
				"No I am not wrong the more muscle you have the more fat you burn. Weight training builds muscle. So as I mentioned if she does the punching which is cardio combined with weight training it will increase her results. Not to mention if you do all cardio you will lose weight. However you may also be left with extra skin, that is why weight training is essential for toning.",

				"I love Rachel's idea!:-)",
				"@ Miya~are you part chinese/part jewish and do you live in San Diego? Cuz I SWEAR you act just like my MOH. What's even funnier is that I actually dragged her out to go watch Wicked with me, cuz I told her it was the story of \"us\" as we were growing up~haha I'm sure it's not too hard to figure out which witch was representing which one in this scenario anyways, @ Natalie D. ~ not saying that you did because your response seemed very chill, but yeah, whatever Miya says should never be taken personally but she will (if she's anything like my MOH) be VERY blunt about the way she puts thing. For example, to questions like \"does this dress make me look fat?\" my MOH's response would be \"yes, it makes you look fat and it accentuates your love handles. Also, I really don't like that color on you.\" haha~but I've learned to appreciate her honesty and directness since girls can be a bit too frilly and confusing about what they think with all their attempts at trying to put things \"nicely\".",
				"@ Sara M. ~ I agree. Rachel probably gave the best advice so far~and it would make your FI very very happy",
				"Natalie- while you were trying to help, the way you phrased your statements made them completely incorrect. You were heading down the right road, just didn't stay on it... But we've all clarified. I think in your excitement with being able to help, you just typed faster than your brain kept up- I do it all the time!",
				"LOL Meghan either that or it was the vicodin from my surgery or the fact that I was using my iphone at the time and took the lazy route. However I dont think it sounded completely incorrect just not thoroughly explained like you ladies did. Totally not upset just wanted to address Miya because no where in my message did I say rely solely on weight training. I clearly referenced the punching and the other exercises the ladies mentioned for cardio along with weight training. And on my weight loss journey, and interaction with professionals. I know for a fact weight training will increase your results. Possibly if she can build muscle while she is sedentary she can burn fat and if not lose weight, hopefully maintain.",
				"Crystal all my girlfriends said they hated weights too. Until they say how much I was able to lose and sculpt my body when I added the weight training. I absolutely love them now. When I wanted to lose the fat I went real heavy on the cardio. And my Dr. and a trainer said while youre getting rid of the fat, you need to build muscle along the way for definition and ultimate fat burn. I went from losing 4lbs a month to almost 8-9lbs a month. Which ultimately landed me at 55lbs. They also told me that muscle even helps you heal faster and I knew I had a medical procedure coming. So I researched, added the weights and combined with medical and professional trainer advice I learned so much. Its not as bad as you think and very hard for a woman to get bulky if thats a concern",

				"I didn't go through insurance..I just paid for it out right. It was about 3500$ (I got a 10% discount card because a friend had gotten it done as well). They had the option of doing a payment plan if you got approved because it is technically a loan, but I didn't go that route. Depending on the place you go to some charge different amounts based on the prescription of your eye; at the place I went it is a flat rate for the procedure regardless of your eyes. Depends on where you go. Only go to a place that does a free consultation (they shouldn't charge you in case you are not eligible for the surgery) and they can give you all of the information. I heard insurance companies are starting to include it. But they also said I should try to submit through my health spending account etc.",

				"Smaller portions saucer size snack every 3-4hrs small healthy snacks veggies nuts etc basically that gives you 3 meals and 3snacks. Which keeps your metabolism going.

				"I lost 16 pounds on Weight Watchers in about 4 months, without majorly exercising. My old company sponsored a WW at work program, and I enrolled from Jan-April of last year. I followed the old point system, and lost 16 pounds! I'm not a fan of cardio/weights, so I defintely didn't do anything out of the ordinary in the exercise department. (I normally do basic exercise such as taking the stairs, parking far away, walking on a regular basis.) I started at 156 and ended at 140. It was easy once you got past the first month or so. I've been off it for over a year, and I have gained back 6 lbs, but that's because I eat like garbage. I will go back on the plan shortly and incorporate exercise because I know I can have even better results. WW is great because it teaches you portion control. Even though I no longer follow the plan I'm always aware of what I'm consuming (I just ignore my guilty conscious.) GOOD LUCK!",
				"Weight watchers is good for some people each individual has to find what works for them long term. I have two friends who lost tons of weight with weight watchers. One gained it back other one kept it off. But one of my friends lost nothing. Your goal should always be to be healthy not just lose weight. Everyone for good health requires exercise. If you can't afford a plan like weight watchers a nutritionist will give you the same information minus the meetings.",
				"I love myfitnesspal.com! I've lost 22 pounds and use it religiously to log my food intake. You'd be shocked at how many calories you're eating a day! When you total up for the day, it tells you how much weight you'd lose in 5 weeks if you ate the same way you did today. When you see that you'd actually GAIN weight eating how you normally eat, it might shock you into action :-) Also, I just don't go near fast food, bread, potatos, cake, cookies, candies or rice. Sounds harder than it is. I do all the groceries, and don't allow any crap in the house. FH very supportive. I echo everyopne on the water intake. And I walk 5 miles a day from work to home, which is also easier than you think. I've also, just cut a lot of tv time. I find TV=mindless snacking! Laslty- if you have an ipod, I've been using a weightloss hypnosis app which discourages eating bad food and snacking. I have to say, it's kind of worked and if nothing else, helps me fall aslep faster! Good luck!",
				"@Natalie - I totally agree. Exercise is clearly an important part of a healthy lifestyle. I was just sharing my experience on WW, and honestly I didn't do a ton of exercise. I have a friend who has been on WW for seven months. She follows the plan religiously and began working out at the gym. She lost almost 60 pounds. She looks amazing. Not only has she lost weight, but she's feeling healthier. I think that a healthy lifestyle and weight loss go hand in hand. I'm not recommending WW just to lose weight. I'm recommending it because it teaches you how about living a healthier lifestyle. It's also not a quick fix. 16 pounds in four months averages out to 1lb/week.",

				"@Kerry yes totally agree wasnt at all debating that WW isnt good. And it totally isnt a quick fix. Was only referencing that people have to find what works for them. Almost any diet will work if you follow it. Most of them are teaching portion control and exercise. Slimfast, jennycraig, etc Some people donot do well following those programs. It requires discipline. For instance my friend who did WW still does not understand portion control. When they started giving more points for fruits she started over indulging in them. I personally know someone who did WW and she started at a size 18 and is now a 4. Im so happy for her and proud of her. I went to WW meetings before and their program is nice. If you cant afford it and find a good nutritionist. They teach you the exact same thing. But of course WW has the group support. So Im not knocking it if it works thats great. Personally Ive found that discipline, exercise and persistence are the key. Any diet program is a great jumpstart.",
				"Continued..... but in the end its all mind over matter. Because if you dont stick to it. You wont lose weight.@THW vegetarian is a great way to go if you can. I became a pesco-vegetarian over a year ago. Best decision I ever made for me. Lost 15lbs right away. Then added more exercise now down 55lbs",
				"ZUMBA!!! Works wonders! I got in great shape with zumba and it's so fun and addicting!",
				"Also I ask myself the following questions prior to eating to help ensure that I eat healthy: 1. Am I hungry? If so how hungry am I? 2. Is eating this food worth the calories? 3. Will you regret eating this food? 4. Is there a healthier option I can choose? 5. What have you eaten already today?",
				"Good one Sara",
				"Never heard of pesco-vegetarian before. I have to look that up",
				"Alright, I know it sounds weird but... this is what I do. I have a bowl of cereal and banana for breakfast. I have whatever I want for lunch. Seriously, I eat cheese steaks, Chipotle burritos, burgers, etc. Then for dinner I eat a giant bowl of plain salad and a couple pickles. In the past whenever I have tried to deprive myself, it doesn't work. Only makes me crave the bad stuff even worse. I've lost (and kept off) 15 pounds.",
				"Try to fit the gym in your sched somehow. Just think of how beautiful & comfortable you want to look in your dress. Easier to put it on than to get it off. :- ( But you can do it with alot of effort.... It's your day, you'll look beautiful either way on your day. Best of luck!",
				"Tons of water, 3-4 times a week I bring up an exercise program on on-demand and work out ... I try my hardest to not eat after 7pm ... and do a lot of portion control ...",
				"P90X is amazing! It is a total workout and diet plan - when my FH and I did it earlier this year, we could see the results rather quickly. We did not follow the diet plan exactly because it is quite strict and we don't eat too badly anyways. Another thing I keep hearing lately is 10,000 steps a day. Get one of those pedometers and make sure you walk and I'm sure it will help. The other think I do (my FH does not like to eat is fruit and veggies) is grate or puree fruit and veg into anything and everything. For example, I made cookies and put pureed chickpeas in (which you can't even taste), use half white flour and half whole wheat (or even all whole wheat), nuts, raisins and a few chocolate chips for a treat. In lasagna, spaghetti, tacos etc I grate carrot and zucchini, sometimes sweet potatoe into the meat while I am frying it up. Depending on how much red meat we have had, use turkey or chicken mince instead. Work the good stuff into your fav dishes.",
				"I am trying to lose 40lbs by my wedding day. I had a baby 6mths ago so alot of it is still baby fat...i am doing zumba i already lost 12lbs in one mth...i had to work hard on my portions and my snacking all the time...also junk food was an issue...i am a nurse and sometimes i dont have time to eat healthy i just grab what i can find in a vending machine and eat it and thats not good...I started premaking and planning my workout and meals one week ahead...Its help me save money and lose weight both A+ in my book...good luck"

				"Yeah the Jillian Michaels DVD's are for people that not 100% out of shape. I talked to a trainer at my gym and he said the same thing. Those P90X dvds are even worse. My friend said it was rough but, not impossible to do them. To stick to the meal plan and do them that's nearly impossible she said and she was running 3 miles or more a day with tons of bleacher running at the UF stadium.",

				"Jillian Michaels is torture but I enjoy her workout dvds, I just did the No More Trouble Zones one today and seriously thought I was going to die! But if she can get my behind into shape and make me look absolutely stunning in my wedding dress then I'm all for it. I've thought about Zumba may add it to my workout routine but I'm a really really bad dancer ...",

				"Anything else out there (videos) that working for anyone other than Zumba?",
				"Denise, taebo is pretty sweet. Give it a Try!",
				"Awesome! I take Zumba at my gym almost every day..it's so much fun! Don't rely on that alone to get you in shape though...it's great for cardio, but you need something for toning too. Jillian is good for that. You can also look into WillPower & Grace, which kicks my butt on Mondays and Fridays....seriously, the first time I took it, I had to walk up stairs sideways for 3 days.",
				"I'm in a Zumba class every Monday and Wednesday. After work, I come home and it is just SO hard to drag myself out to go there...but after about 10 minutes- I'm SO glad I'm there! It is REALLY fun, and you sweat your butt off!! I haven't done the DVD, but I know personally that I need the accountability of actually going somewhere and doing it. And, I've made friends in the class that will question why I wasn't there...makes me realize that someone else is paying attention- which pushes me to be sure to go! Enjoy it!",
				"I've been working out at my local Y for two hours a day since January 3. And I'm still walking up stairs funny! It's not a specific program, though. I use the stationary bicycle on the cardio setting (70-80% of maximum theoretical heart rate) for 30 minutes plus a 5-minute cooldown. I then do a circuit of all the weight machines. And then I go back to the stationary bike for another 35 minutes. By the end of all that, I'm typically dripping sweat everywhere! ;-) Ok, I only hit the submit button once. Why did it post three times?",
				"@Designingbride- Wtf? lol I did the 30DS for the full 30 days. Since then, I have a hard time getting into it. I bought No More Trouble Zones a week ago. I've done it twice, and hate life during it lol. I've tried Zumba on DVD at FMIL's house, and while it's enjoyable, I feel like I look totally goofy doing it lol. Maybe I'll check it out on Wii, though.",
				"I'm in the minority here but I love BOTH P90X and Jillian Micheals. Have been seeing great results with both. Admittedly I am in good shape as I work out often (5-6 days a week) so this was like kicking that up a level.",
				"For those ladies with a Wii the Wii Active is great. It's by EA sports & it makes you sweat but a lot of the exercises trick you into it. There's a rollerblading sequence that tricks you into doing squats for 5 minutes. Oh the pain!!! it's a lot more effective than the wii fit and you don't need a balance board.",
				"LMAO @Denisie. I have a few Jillian DVDs, I like them..but I put some Zumba dvds on reserve from the library so i'll check it out, all this raving on WW about zumba has gotten me curious! looks like fun! :-)",
				"@Andrene P. I have the P90X and the Jillian...butmy body is not in shape to even beging those workouts..The bananas and the X thingy were insane for me.I admire you for being able to do it",
				"Okay I have P90X and I've watched it, but that's as far as I've gotten with it. I did order my Zumba fitness from Amazon today. I'll try that out and see how it works. Oh and maybe I should actually use my gym membership.",
				"I agree, P90X probably isn't for a true beginer or someone who hasn't worked out in years but I think once you've spent a few months doing a regular routine it wouldn't be too bad. I found level 1 of the 30 Day Shred a bit too easy so after a week I've moved on to Level 2. I can already tell that my body is adjusting so I may move on to Level 3 next week. I also ordered her Boost Your Metablosim DVD so will give that a try in March. Another thing I highly reccomend is Bikram yoga if you find a studio that offers it. It's hot yoga so you probably want to ease into it after a few months of working out."

			"title": "birth control & weight gain",
			"content": "Hello I've been on YAZ for about 8 months now. I gained about 15 lbs in 2 months and have been trying to lose it ever since with no luck. I was put on it for acne treatment. Anyways, I went to find a dress on Saturday and literally started crying knowing I went up 2 dress sizes. I guess the weight gain didn\u2019t really bother me until going to look for a dress for my wedding day! I called my doctor this morning and told him I want to stop taking YAZ. Am I being ridiculous? The pill hasn\u2019t done anything for my skin either. Has anyone else experienced crazy weight gain with YAZ?",
			"comments": [
				"OMG GET OFF OF YAZ! weight gain, depression and I lost my gall bladder its a horriable BC.",
				"I never took YAZ but I was on a different birth control. I gained weight when I started taking it too so I stopped taking it. I don't know anything about birth control in relation to acne but I have heard that birth control with low to no estrogen doesn't make you gain weight.",
				"YAZ is terrible! I gained about 20 pounds over the 6 months I was on it and I'm finally starting to loose the weight. I was so upset, and still am, because I've never weighed this much in my entire life and I consider myself a healthy person.",
				"Wow sorry to hear that Michelle, I haven't experienced any other side effects but weight gain and now reading even more about YAZ i'm done. As far as the acne treatment, BC seems to be the thing to do these days to help but I'm so done with it. I just feel so disgusted with the weight gain! My chest got huge and my hips and thighs! But when I googled weight gain associated with YAZ it seemed a lot of people were experiencing weight loss.",
				"I agree. YAZ is a horrible pill. I was on it for a while and gained 20lbs, had terrible migraines, no sex drive and horrible depression. It was a last ditch effort for me as no other BC seem to work and all make me very sick. FH and I now just stick to non-latex condoms (i'm a lergic to latex). Good luck.",
				"Ya, I've heard bad things about YAZ as well, however i have not been on it. i think its perfectly reasonable to switch given your description of things!",
				"Yaz is TERRIBLE. I used it for like 6 months and cried.. all the time, for NO REASON!!! Loestrin is SO much better, i've been the same weight for over a year on it..",
				"Thanks everyone! It's nice to know I'm not alone and I'm officially done with YAZ!",
				"I hated YAZ! It gave me awful migraines, although it did control my \"breakouts\" and i think it was the reason my sex drive was low. I then switched to Seasonique which you only get a period once every three months, which I loved but the downfall of that was weight gain. I went up a whole pants size. Maybe talk to your OB and see what they can do?",
				"I had problems with all BC pills, but Yaz was by far the worse. Not only did I gain a lot of weight, but my migraines were worse than ever and my fingers and lips would get numb and tingly all the time. When I did some research and found the high risk of a stroke from Yaz, no matter how young or healthy you are, I tossed them all out!",
				"See the thing is it's not helping with the breakouts and that was the main factor of starting it. I'm definitely going to see what my other options are. Because the weight gain is just out of control.",
				"For anyone that did stop taking YAZ, how long did it take to see a difference with the weight you gained? I'm not looking to lose 20lbs in a month. But my chest going down some would be nice =\\",
				"@Stephanie: It took me 6 months to drop the 20lbs that I gained while on YAZ. The was due to agressive exercisie and diet though so it may take longer than that if you go a bit slower.",
				"Thanks Andrene, time to get aggressive then!",
				"I hate to say it, but i am coming to find out that all bc's make you gain weight. unless you are some rare case. I am stuck because i really want to get off the shot, but we are not ready to conceive and condoms seem to be a no-go for the FH. I have gained over thirty lbs over the last 3 years, and trust me, the whole time i have been trying to get it off. Ill lose 20 and gain it all right back. Weight wasn't really an issue for me untill bc. Also ACNE, so bad. I had NEVER had acne in my life untill i got on depo. and headaches galore. UGH. I have a shot appt this friday and i think after that i am calling it quits. we'll just have to be careful.",
				"It's so discouraging, how something is supposed to help you in one way but destroys you in another way. good luck future mrs. lord!",
				"I have done a lot of research on birth control and weight gain, and understand you frustration. BC in a necessary evil right now and I can't wait untill we are ready to start trying for kids so I can stop taking it. From what I understand, many of the problems surrounding BC and weight gain come from the fact that the hormones make it very hard for a woman's body to build and maintain muscle, and we all know that our muscle helps keep our metabolic rate up and maintain a healthy weight. I started looking into it because I have been weight training for a year and seeing very little gain in muscle mass. I've had my doctor switch me to Microgestin (also known as Loestrin 24) which he said is the lowest dose of both estrogen and progesterone out there. Even with the lowest dose, it's still very hard to lose weight and build muscle. One of the frustrating things about being a woman.....",
				"I absolutely love loestrin. short icky weeks, very little headaches/migraines (and i get migraines SUPER easy) i havent had any weight gain at all, sex drive is the same. go loestrin!",
				"It all depends on your body, this really doesn't have much to do with the BCP either, some women gain weight, some lose weight and some remain neutral. each person response differently, I was on the same pill as a friend of mine a few years back, I gained about 15 pounds while she was losing them. last year I was on loestrin, didn't gain any weight, I was pretty much neutral on it. As for YAZ, I've heard a lot of crazy things about it, I'd suggest you stop taking it",
				"I also lost my gallbadder and have a h/o yaz use, and yes, I gained weight on it. You should focus on your upper body since that is the part that is exposed in most wedding dresses (triceps for sure). Do bench dips. You can do a few sets of 10-15 through out the day with little effort and still see a noticable difference by week 2. It'd stop taking the pill and just do abstinence till after your wedding. It will give you something to look foward to on your honey moon night, and the motivation to work out until then.",
				"Stop taking the pill and ask about Mirena or...*blinks* I forgot the name of the other IUD. They work and I don't have any weight gain problems. I hated BC pills, nuva ring, and I refused to try depo. BC pills away caused really really bad health problems for me. Mainly dealing with breathing issues and other things. Very horrible. Also working out or if you are lazy like me, they have things (clothing) that shrinks your waist size a bit.",
				"I have taken YAZ for years and have not had any weight gain, depression, or any other negative side effects. I would look into other things that may have changed since you started taking the medicine. Also my bridal size is a size bigger than I wear anything else. I don't know what it is that way, but for me I just didn't see it as an issue.",
				"I feel your pain! I've never been on Yaz but have been on/off bc for years. I gained a quick 30lbs with ONE DepoProvera shot years ago (ugh!...) and I think it took me around 5-6months to lose it. Then eventually gained 25lbs AGAIN w/another bc, though more slowly. No, I haven't lost it. My only saving grace was that I was very thin before/used to be able to fit into size 5s, so now I'm a respectable sz8 at 5'8\"/not bad. Still grieve the thinner days.",
				"I had to go off all BC pills because each one had a different problem for me, headaches, weight gain, really bad acne, mood swings. I looked into the IUD but it needs to stay in there for the five years to be worth the money, and that was the only non-hormonal option my doctor would offer. We tried condoms but DH didn't like them, I tried spermicide but I had a bad reaction, so we switched to withdrawl, which lead to me now being 7 months pregnant. Moral of that story: All birth control options have a downside, you just have to find the lesser of evils for you. NOT that I consider being pregnant a downside in the least, as unplanned as it was we are beyond thrilled, but obviously that wouldn't be the case for everyone!",
				"I have never been on BC and I have been considering a Seasonique since it only gives you 4 periods a year. have you guys heard anything about this BC? I have been looking for reviews but im not sure. does it have the same side effects as this YAZ pill?",
				"I have been on Orthtricyclen for years (well Tri-Sprintec the generic actually) and have had no weight gain, have been able to build muscle mass when working out, and my skin (the reason I went on it) has been so much better than before I started on it.",
				"@Jackie- It comes down to trial and error with the pills. The reviews are not really helpful because everyone's body is different, and each pill is different, and you just have to try and try again until you find a good match. I have friends who never had a problem with any pills, and then there are people like me who just can't take them at all. Hopefully you will get lucky with it!",
				"-.- man. I think I may ask about it later... I'm just kinda worried because i usually start my period the second week of the month and my wedding is on the 11th, if i dont try seasonique or something to stop it... i will probably be on my period for my honey moon... EEWWWWW!! D=",
				"@Jackie- if you do decide to go on it to stop your period, do it early so your body can adjust. The first couple of months can be the worse if you do have a bad reaction, and you don't want to be bloated and broken out on your wedding day! Also, seasonique doesn't always *stop* periods right away, it can take awhile, although they should be lighter and shorter. I didn't take that brand myself, but did do a lot of research on it! I used my regular brand to stop periods before, for vacations and things like that, just going from the active pills into the new pack instead of taking the week of sugar pills. I spotted sometimes, other times had nothing but the next month ended up with two periods. All this BC talk has reminded me once again that I really need to figure out what I'm going to take after the baby is born. Sigh... it's been wonderful not having to worry about that.",
				"I gained 40 pounds on YAZ and am now just starting to drop the weight! However, everyone is right there is no way around weight gain when you are on birth control. My sex drive was also way way WAY down when I was on it ... Talk to your doctor about the nuva ring, that seems to have little to no weight gain for my friends who use it. I'm trying for Seasonique or Loestrin next time I got to my OB/GYN but I am staying away from YAZ and Yasmin!",
				"@Jackie-I was on Seasonique for about a year. I switched from Orho-Novum (might not be the exact name), so I could have a period once every three months. Ended up spotting constantly and having bad pains and cramping in my female organs. Sex was very painful too which had never happened before. My blood pressure went up and my migraines got worse. I've been off all BC for about 15 months and my pressure is much better and I don't have cramps or pain or spotting. I have irregular periods again just like when I was a teenager, but it's a small price to pay for all the misery from Seasonique. Everyone is different though, so you might do well on it. It was just very bad for me.",
				"I've never tried yaz, but I've been taking ortho tri cyclen lo for about for about 6 years or so and have not had any weight or acne problems. It's a very low dosage so I guess it doesn't affect your weight as much. I also have no cramping at all.",
				"I gianed weight on Yaz too, but also on Ortho Evra (the skin patch). All BC makes me gain weight, and its the kind of weight that is impossible to get off I feel your pain girl. BC ruined my body. I gained 45 pounds in 3 years",
				"Just be sure that your next method is effective. Having lost two of my nannies in a row at one point when each of them had a diaphragm, I'm particularly sensitive to needing to make sure your method is effective. In response to AidaLily, the other IUD besides Mirena is the ParaGard, which is copper-based rather than hormone-based. I used a predecessor to the ParaGard at one point, and loved it."
